Her blood tests show normal renal and liver function, and normal coagulation profile. She is not allergic to any drugs.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB. 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then 20 mg once daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF and NICE guidance, the recommended dosing regimen of rivaroxaban for the initial treatment of acute DVT (or PE) is:\r\n\r\n- 15 mg twice daily for the first 21 days\r\n\r\n- Then 20 mg once daily for continued treatment and prevention of recurrence\r\n\r\n- This regimen ensures a rapid onset of anticoagulation followed by a maintenance dose to prevent further thrombotic events.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. 10 mg once daily for 14 days\r\n\r\nThis dose is used for prophylaxis of DVT (e.g. after hip/knee surgery), not for acute treatment of DVT.\r\n\r\nC. 15 mg twice daily for 3 months\r\n\r\nWhile the 15 mg twice daily dose is correct for initial treatment, it should only be used for the first 21 days. Extending this dose for 3 months is not recommended due to increased bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nD. 20 mg once daily for 3 months\r\n\r\nThis is the correct maintenance dose after the initial 21-day loading phase, but starting directly on 20 mg once daily without the loading dose is not appropriate for acute DVT.\r\n\r\nE. 20 mg twice daily for 21 days, then 10 mg once daily\r\n\r\nThese doses do not reflect the recommended DVT treatment protocol for rivaroxaban. There is no evidence supporting this regimen in acute DVT management.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of acute DVT, rivaroxaban is started at 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, followed by 20 mg once daily for long-term prevention. Deviations from this schedule are either incorrect for treatment or used in different clinical contexts like prophylaxis.",

Emergency electrical cardioversion is appropriate in this scenario. However, even in emergencies, there is a risk of thromboembolism due to potential dislodgement of atrial thrombi. Therefore, anticoagulation is required before and after the procedure. When immediate cardioversion is necessary, intravenous unfractionated heparin is used to rapidly anticoagulate, followed by a direct oral anticoagulant for at least 4 weeks to maintain protection against stroke.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) DOAC for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after the procedure\r\n\r\nThis is used when cardioversion is elective and can be delayed to allow three weeks of anticoagulation before the procedure. It does not apply in an emergency setting like this.\r\n\r\nB) Heparin bolus followed by infusion, then warfarin for at least 4 weeks\r\n\r\nThis is an acceptable option but less preferred in current clinical practice due to the need for INR monitoring and slower onset of warfarin. DOACs are now generally favoured unless contraindicated.\r\n\r\nD) No anticoagulation required\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Anticoagulation is essential in both elective and emergency cardioversion to reduce the risk of stroke.\r\n\r\nE) Warfarin for at least 3 weeks before and 4 weeks after the procedure\r\n\r\nThis option applies to planned cardioversion, not emergency. There is no time to wait three weeks in this patient with haemodynamic instability.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn emergency cardioversion, anticoagulation should be started immediately with intravenous heparin, followed by a DOAC for at least 4 weeks to reduce thromboembolic risk.",

She is prescribed gentamicin 7 mg/kg once daily by intravenous infusion. Her serum creatinine is 70 micromol/L and her weight is 50 kg.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Pseudomonas aeruginosa\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a common Gram-negative pathogen associated with chronic respiratory infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis. These patients are prone to colonisation and acute exacerbations caused by this organism due to impaired mucociliary clearance and thick, tenacious mucus in the airways.\r\n\r\nGentamicin, an aminoglycoside, is used intravenously in hospital settings for its bactericidal action against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Clostridium difficile\r\n\u2192 Incorrect. Gentamicin is not effective against anaerobic organisms like C. difficile, which commonly causes antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Treatment typically involves oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.\r\n\r\nB) Escherichia coli\r\n\u2192 Incorrect. While gentamicin does have activity against E. coli, in the context of cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis, E. coli is not a common respiratory pathogen. The question clearly points to a respiratory context.\r\n\r\nD) Staphylococcus aureus\r\n\u2192 Incorrect. S. aureus can be a respiratory pathogen in CF, especially in children and early adolescence, but the first-line treatment would typically include flucloxacillin or vancomycin (for MRSA). Gentamicin is not first-line for Gram-positive cocci.\r\n\r\nE) Streptococcus pneumoniae\r\n\u2192 Incorrect. While a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive diplococcus, and gentamicin has limited use here due to resistance and poor penetration into respiratory secretions.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis are at high risk of chronic lung colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen that increases morbidity and accelerates lung function decline. According to UK guidance (e.g. NICE and BNF), empirical therapy during acute exacerbations in these patients often includes anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, such as:\r\n\r\n- IV gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, or meropenem, depending on local microbiology and severity.\r\n\r\n- Nebulised antibiotics like colistimethate may also be used chronically in Pseudomonas-colonised patients.\r\n\r\n- Therapy is typically guided by previous sputum cultures and local antimicrobial policies, and kidney function must be monitored due to gentamicin's nephrotoxicity.",

Amiodarone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug (Class III) that inhibits myocardial ATPase activity by blocking sodium and potassium channels. It is indicated for the treatment of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, including:\r\n\r\nSupraventricular tachycardia (SVT)\r\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) with haemodynamic instability\r\nVentricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF)\r\nIntravenous (IV) amiodarone is administered in emergency settings, particularly when a patient presents with a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia resistant to other treatments. The mechanism involves:\r\n\r\nBlocking sodium and potassium channels, prolonging the action potential duration.\r\nSlowing conduction through the AV node and suppressing abnormal pacemaker activity.\r\nReducing myocardial oxygen consumption, which helps stabilise cardiac rhythm.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Adenosine\r\n\r\nUsed for rapid termination of SVT, but acts via adenosine receptor activation, not by sodium and potassium channel inhibition. It is not effective for all supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.\r\n\r\nC. Amphotericin\r\n\r\nAn antifungal agent used for systemic fungal infections. It has no role in treating cardiac arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nD. Ciclosporin\r\n\r\nAn immunosuppressant used in organ transplantation and autoimmune diseases. It does not affect cardiac conduction.\r\n\r\nE. Infliximab\r\n\r\nA TNF-alpha inhibitor used for inflammatory conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It does not have any antiarrhythmic properties.\r\n\r\nF. Insulin\r\n\r\nUsed for diabetes management and not involved in cardiac conduction regulation.\r\n\r\nG. Phenytoin\r\n\r\nAn antiepileptic drug that also has antiarrhythmic properties, but it is mainly used in digoxin-induced arrhythmias, not acute supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r\n\r\nH. Tacrolimus\r\n\r\nAn immunosuppressant used in transplantation. It can cause QT prolongation and arrhythmias as a side effect but is not used to treat arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nAmiodarone and High-Risk Medication Considerations\r\nAmiodarone is a high-risk medication due to its long half-life, multiple drug interactions, and serious adverse effects, including:\r\n\r\nBradycardia and hypotension (especially with IV use)\r\nThyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism)\r\nPulmonary fibrosis (long-term use risk)\r\nLiver toxicity\r\nPhotosensitivity and skin reactions\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend using amiodarone in a hospital setting under specialist supervision, particularly in acute emergency cases like SVT with haemodynamic compromise.

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE. Infliximab\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nInfliximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), a key inflammatory mediator in Crohn\u2019s disease. It is recommended for moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease that has not responded to conventional treatment (e.g., corticosteroids, azathioprine, or methotrexate).\r\n\r\nBefore initiation, NICE guidelines recommend screening for tuberculosis (TB) using a Mantoux test, an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), or a chest X-ray. This is because TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors can reactivate latent TB, leading to life-threatening complications.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Adenosine\r\n\r\nUsed for the rapid termination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It has no role in treating Crohn\u2019s disease or modulating immune responses.\r\n\r\nB.

Insulin\r\n\r\nA hormone used in the management of diabetes mellitus. It is unrelated to Crohn\u2019s disease.\r\n\r\nG. Phenytoin\r\n\r\nAn anticonvulsant used for epilepsy and certain arrhythmias. It has no role in autoimmune or inflammatory conditions.\r\n\r\nH. Tacrolimus\r\n\r\nAnother immunosuppressant mainly used in transplant rejection prevention and sometimes for ulcerative colitis, but not typically for Crohn\u2019s disease.\r\n\r\nInfliximab and High-Risk Medication Considerations\r\nInfliximab is classified as a high-risk medication due to its potential for severe infections, infusion reactions, and malignancy risks. \r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend the following before starting treatment:\r\n\r\nScreening for latent tuberculosis (Mantoux test, IGRA, or chest X-ray)\r\n\r\nTesting for hepatitis B and C\r\n\r\nEnsuring patients are up to date with vaccinations (e.g., pneumococcal, flu, and COVID-19 vaccines)\r\nMonitoring for infusion-related reactions and long-term risks, such as lymphoma or demyelinating disease\r\nIn Crohn\u2019s disease, infliximab is particularly beneficial for patients with fistulising disease or severe inflammation unresponsive to conventional therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more Information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 1 (Gastro-intestinal System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She is taking alendronic acid 70 mg once a week and calcium and vitamin D supplements. She visits your community pharmacist for a medication review and reports feeling dizzy and faint when she stands up from a sitting or lying position. She has fallen twice in the past month due to this problem.",
    "why": "A: Advise the patient to stop taking amlodipine and see her GP as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAmlodipine, a calcium channel blocker (CCB), lowers blood pressure by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. However, in elderly patients, it can cause postural hypotension (a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing), which increases the risk of dizziness, fainting, and falls. This is particularly concerning in patients with osteoporosis, as falls can lead to fractures. Given this patient\u2019s symptoms and fall history, stopping amlodipine and referring her to her GP for an alternative treatment is the safest course of action.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Advise the patient to reduce the dose of amlodipine to 2.5 mg once daily and monitor her blood pressure:\r\nWhile lowering the dose may reduce side effects, postural hypotension can still occur, especially in vulnerable elderly patients. Discontinuation is the preferred action.\r\n\r\nC: Advise the patient to take amlodipine at night instead of in the morning and drink plenty of fluids:\r\nChanging the timing of the dose or increasing hydration will not address the underlying issue of postural hypotension caused by amlodipine in this patient.\r\n\r\nD: Advise the patient to continue taking amlodipine as prescribed and use a walking stick or frame for support:\r\nThis option fails to address the root cause of the symptoms. Continuing amlodipine puts the patient at risk of further falls and injuries.\r\n\r\nE: Advise the patient to switch from amlodipine to another calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem or verapamil:\r\nBoth diltiazem and verapamil can also cause postural hypotension, and switching to them is unlikely to resolve the issue. A different class of antihypertensive agents should be considered.\r\n\r\nPostural Hypotension in Elderly Patients on Antihypertensive Therapy\r\n\r\nPostural hypotension is a common adverse effect of antihypertensives, particularly in elderly patients.\r\nAmlodipine, while effective in lowering blood pressure, may cause excessive vasodilation, leading to dizziness, fainting, and falls.\r\nFalls are especially concerning in patients with osteoporosis, as they increase the risk of fractures.\r\nAlternative antihypertensive medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs, may be safer for elderly patients prone to postural hypotension.\r\nRegular monitoring of blood pressure and a medication review are essential to prevent adverse effects in this population.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "G. Pregnancy and lactation\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is a retinoid known to cause teratogenicity (severe harm to the foetus). It is contraindicated in pregnant women, women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception, and women who are breastfeeding. Women prescribed isotretinoin must follow strict guidelines under the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, which includes using two reliable methods of contraception (one being a barrier method) and undergoing regular pregnancy tests before, during, and for one month after treatment. Alcohol should also be avoided to reduce the risk of liver toxicity.\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin can cause significant congenital abnormalities if taken during pregnancy. To prevent this, strict measures such as effective contraception and pregnancy testing are required. The Pregnancy Prevention Programme helps ensure the drug is prescribed safely to women of childbearing potential.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nThere is no contraindication for isotretinoin use in patients with asthma or COPD unless these conditions require medications that could interact with isotretinoin.\r\n\r\nB. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is not specifically contraindicated in cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, though caution may be needed in patients with hyperlipidaemia, as isotretinoin can increase cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\r\n\r\nC. Concomitant use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets\r\n\r\nThere is no direct contraindication for isotretinoin use with anticoagulants or antiplatelets, though caution may be warranted as isotretinoin can increase the risk of mucocutaneous bleeding.\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin may exacerbate hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients but is not contraindicated. Patients with diabetes require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels during treatment.\r\n\r\nE. History of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is not contraindicated in patients with a history of peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. However, patients should be monitored for any new or worsening gastrointestinal symptoms.\r\n\r\nF. Liver disease or alcoholism\r\n\r\nLiver disease or alcoholism is a relative contraindication for isotretinoin, as the drug is hepatotoxic. In this case, the patient has no liver dysfunction or history of alcoholism, so this option is not relevant.\r\n\r\nH. Severe renal impairment\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is not contraindicated in renal impairment, though dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe renal disease.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, isotretinoin is an effective treatment for severe acne but requires careful monitoring due to its potential adverse effects. It is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenicity, and strict measures such as the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be followed for women of childbearing potential. Patients should also be monitored for liver function, lipid levels, and signs of depression or psychiatric disorders during treatment. Safe prescribing practices and thorough patient counselling are essential when initiating isotretinoin therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 13 (skin): \r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 30-year-old man with type 1 diabetes is treated with multiple daily injection basal-bolus insulin regimen to control his blood glucose levels. He wants to know which activity can lower his insulin needs and reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nD. Physical activity\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, physical activity significantly increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by muscles, which in turn lowers insulin requirements in people with type 1 diabetes. While this is beneficial for long-term control and overall health, it also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia if insulin doses and carbohydrate intake are not appropriately adjusted.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the risk of hypos:\r\n\r\n- Monitor blood glucose before, during, and after activity\r\n\r\n- Adjust insulin dosage (especially rapid-acting)\r\n\r\n- Consume carbohydrate snacks as needed\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Certain endocrine disorders\r\n\r\nConditions like Cushing's syndrome or thyrotoxicosis may actually increase insulin resistance and therefore increase insulin needs, not decrease them.\r\n\r\nB. Impaired renal function\r\n\r\nReduced kidney function can impair insulin clearance, prolonging insulin action and increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, but it is not classified as an \"activity\" and usually necessitates medical dose adjustment rather than being a modifiable behaviour.\r\n\r\nC. Intercurrent illness\r\n\r\nIllness typically increases insulin requirements due to stress-induced counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. This is the opposite of what the question is asking.\r\n\r\nE. Reduced food intake\r\n\r\nThis can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia but doesn't directly decrease insulin requirements. Rather, insulin dosing must be carefully managed to prevent hypo in the context of low carbohydrate availability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity and lowers insulin requirements.\r\n\r\n- Sick days, stress, infection, and endocrine disorders typically increase insulin needs.\r\n\r\n- Insulin regimens should be adjusted according to lifestyle, food intake, and activity.\r\n\r\n- Patient education is essential to prevent hypo/hyperglycaemia in dynamic situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 6) The Endocrine system:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Flucloxacillin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor non-severe cellulitis (i.e. no systemic symptoms, no lymphangitis, not rapidly spreading), the first-line antibiotic is:\r\n\r\nFlucloxacillin orally, 500 mg to 1 g four times daily for 5 days (can be extended to 7 days if needed).\r\n\r\nFlucloxacillin is effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, which are the most common causative organisms in cellulitis. It is the preferred choice unless the patient has a penicillin allergy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Amoxicillin \r\n\r\nHas limited staphylococcal activity, so not recommended for monotherapy in cellulitis.\r\n\r\nSometimes used in combination with flucloxacillin, but not alone.\r\n\r\nB) Clarithromycin \r\n\r\nConsidered an alternative in patients with penicillin allergy, but not first-line if flucloxacillin is tolerated.\r\n\r\nC) Doxycycline \r\n\r\nAlso an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients, but not first-line for those who can tolerate flucloxacillin.\r\n\r\nE) Nitrofurantoin \r\n\r\nUsed for urinary tract infections, not skin/soft tissue infections.\r\n\r\nF) Phenoxymethylpenicillin (Penicillin V) \r\n\r\nInadequate for treating staphylococcal infections and therefore not suitable for cellulitis.\r\n\r\nG) Trimethoprim \r\n\r\nNot effective against the typical organisms in cellulitis; primarily used for urinary tract infections.\r\n\r\nH) Vancomycin\r\n\r\nReserved for severe cellulitis, MRSA infections, or when oral options are not suitable. Not appropriate in a mild outpatient case.\r\n\r\nCellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. For mild cases (no systemic signs like fever, chills, or lymphangitis), oral flucloxacillin is the first-line antibiotic.\r\n\r\nPatients should be reviewed after 5 days. If the infection is improving, continue to complete the course; if not, consider extending treatment, reviewing diagnosis, or switching to a second-line agent (e.g., clarithromycin or doxycycline in penicillin-allergic patients).\r\n\r\nAppropriate antibiotic selection is crucial not only for effective treatment but also to reduce antimicrobial resistance and unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The correct practice is to write the word 'units' in full.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nB) While using brand names is preferred (e.g., Lantus for insulin glargine, Novorapid for insulin aspart), it is not the primary safety issue in this case. \r\n \r\nC) There is no indication that 10 units of insulin aspart is too low; dose requirements vary based on patient needs.  \r\n\r\nD) The dose of insulin glargine (20 units) is a common starting dose and not necessarily too high for this patient.  \r\n\r\nE) The frequency of insulin aspart, listed as three times daily (tds), is appropriate for administration before meals.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n- Never abbreviate 'units' as 'u' when prescribing insulin.  \r\n- Always write 'units' in full to avoid dosing errors.  \r\n- Check insulin prescriptions for clarity and adherence to BNF guidance.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Her daughter has been reading about the side effects of the patches and is worried about some of the side effects.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC has for Rivastigmine has been provided for this question:[SmPC for Rivastigmine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1185/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "E. Not known\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for rivastigmine 9.5mg/24-hour patches, hepatitis is not listed as a side effect with a known frequency. As such, the frequency is categorized as \"Not Known\". This means that while this adverse event may occur, there is insufficient clinical data to estimate its occurrence rate in patients using the patches.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. >1/10 (Very common): This category includes side effects that affect more than 10% of patients. Common side effects of rivastigmine patches include nausea, diarrhoea, and headache, but hepatitis is not listed in this category.\r\n\r\nB. >1/100, <1/10 (Common): This frequency range applies to side effects that occur in 1-10% of patients. Examples include muscle cramps and dizziness, but not hepatitis.\r\n\r\nC. >1/1,000, <1/100 (Uncommon): Side effects in this category occur in 0.1-1% of patients. Vomiting and fatigue are examples, but hepatitis is not common in this group.\r\n\r\nD. >1/10,000, <1/1,000 (Rare): This category includes side effects that occur in 0.01-0.1% of patients, such as anorexia and insomnia, but hepatitis is not classified as rare in the SmPC.\r\n\r\nSide Effects Frequency: The term \"Not Known\" in the SmPC refers to side effects that lack sufficient data to determine how frequently they occur.\r\nMonitoring: Patients should be monitored for any liver dysfunction symptoms, such as jaundice or unusual fatigue, and these should be reported to healthcare professionals immediately.\r\nRivastigmine's Side Effects: Most side effects of rivastigmine patches are gastrointestinal in nature, and while hepatitis is not commonly reported, vigilance is important.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 61-year old male presents to the pharmacy. He asks for your advice as he explains he feels dizzy, tired and feeling hungry. You notice he is irritable and is sweating. He has been prescribed Canagliflozin 100mg tablets as a new medicine to his current regimen of Metformin 500mg MR tablets, at a dose of one tablet twice a day and Gliclazide 80mg tablets at a dose of once daily\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for canaglifozin has been provided for this question.

    "why": "A. Very common (\u22651/10)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nHypoglycaemia is classified as a very common side effect (\u22651/10) of Canagliflozin when used in combination with sulphonylureas, such as Gliclazide, or insulin. This occurs because Canagliflozin enhances urinary glucose excretion, while sulphonylureas increase insulin secretion, leading to an additive hypoglycaemic effect. Patients experiencing dizziness, tiredness, hunger, irritability, and sweating are displaying typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Immediate treatment with fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., glucose tablets) is necessary, and the patient should be advised to monitor their blood glucose levels more closely.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB. Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10):\r\n\r\nSide effects such as urinary tract infections or genital fungal infections are common with Canagliflozin, but hypoglycaemia in combination with sulphonylureas falls under the very common category.\r\n\r\nC. Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100):\r\n\r\nSide effects like dehydration or increased creatinine levels may occur infrequently with Canagliflozin, but hypoglycaemia is more frequent.\r\n\r\nD. Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000):\r\n\r\nRare side effects of Canagliflozin include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in specific circumstances, but hypoglycaemia is much more prevalent.\r\n\r\nE. Very rare (<1/10,000):\r\n\r\nVery rare side effects are severe allergic reactions or serious skin reactions. Hypoglycaemia in combination therapy is far more common.\r\n\r\nThe NICE guidelines recommend that patients prescribed Canagliflozin alongside sulphonylureas or insulin should be educated about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia, as well as how to manage it. Dose adjustments of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. Pharmacists should provide comprehensive counselling about the potential interactions between Canagliflozin and other antidiabetic medications and the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "A) Avoid\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPropranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, can antagonise the bronchodilator effects of beta-2 agonists like salbutamol. This can worsen asthma symptoms or even precipitate bronchospasm. For this reason, non-selective beta-blockers such as propranolol are contraindicated in patients with asthma. In such cases, selective beta-1 blockers (e.g., bisoprolol) may be considered with caution if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Monitor: While monitoring is essential when prescribing drugs to a patient with lithium toxicity, monitoring alone is not sufficient when there is a significant contraindication such as the use of propranolol in an asthmatic patient.\r\n\r\nC) No interaction: This is incorrect, as there is a clinically significant interaction between propranolol and salbutamol.\r\n\r\nD) Reduce dose: Dose reduction does not mitigate the risk of bronchospasm caused by non-selective beta-blockers in asthma.\r\n\r\nE) Use with caution: Using propranolol with caution is inappropriate due to its significant risk of exacerbating asthma symptoms.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines emphasise avoiding non-selective beta-blockers, such as propranolol, in patients with asthma due to the risk of bronchospasm. When beta-blocker therapy is required, cardioselective beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol or bisoprolol) may be cautiously used under close monitoring. In cases of lithium toxicity, managing the toxicity and preventing further lithium accumulation are the primary concerns, and all interventions must consider the patient's comorbidities.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

However, switching would not help with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).\r\n\r\nB) Lorazepam \r\n\r\nBenzodiazepines like lorazepam are not first-line for BPSD due to the risk of increased confusion, sedation, falls, and paradoxical agitation.\r\nThey may be used short-term for acute distress, but long-term use is discouraged.\r\n\r\nC) Risperidone \r\n\r\nThe only licensed antipsychotic for aggression in Alzheimer's disease (short-term use, up to 6 weeks).\r\nHelps manage agitation, aggression, and hallucinations, but carries stroke risk, so regular review is required.\r\n\r\nD) Quetiapine \r\n\r\nSometimes used off-label for agitation in dementia, but evidence is weaker compared to risperidone.\r\nHas a lower stroke risk but is not licensed for this indication.\r\n\r\nE) Rivastigmine \r\n\r\nAnother cholinesterase inhibitor, like donepezil, used primarily in Lewy body dementia or Parkinson's dementia.\r\nDoes not treat BPSD symptoms like aggression or hallucinations.\r\n\r\nManagement of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD):\r\n\r\n- First-line approach: Non-drug interventions (e.g., structured activities, environmental adjustments, reassurance).\r\n\r\n- Pharmacological treatment: If symptoms cause severe distress or risk of harm, an antipsychotic may be considered.\r\nRisperidone is the only licensed antipsychotic for aggression in Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\r\n\r\n-Duration: Use for the shortest time possible (max 6 weeks) and review regularly to minimise adverse effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nA) Aspirin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), preventing platelet aggregation and increasing bleeding risk. According to NICE guidelines, aspirin should be stopped at least 7 days before surgery to allow platelet function to recover and reduce the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Digoxin\r\n\r\nDigoxin is used for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It does not affect bleeding risk and is usually continued unless there is significant renal impairment or toxicity concerns.\r\n\r\nC) Indapamide \r\n\r\nIndapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic that does not significantly increase bleeding risk. It may be continued perioperatively but should be monitored for fluid and electrolyte imbalances.\r\n\r\nD) Ramipril\r\n\r\nACE inhibitors like ramipril can cause hypotension under anaesthesia, but they do not need to be stopped a full week before surgery. NICE suggests stopping only on the morning of surgery in patients at risk of perioperative hypotension.\r\n\r\nE) Valsartan \r\n\r\nARBs like valsartan may contribute to hypotension under anaesthesia, but stopping a full week before surgery is not routinely required. It may be held on the day of surgery in some cases.\r\n\r\nPreoperative Management of Medications:\r\n\r\nPerioperative medication management is crucial to minimise surgical risks such as bleeding, hypotension, and fluid imbalance.\r\n\r\nDrugs that should be stopped before surgery:\r\n\r\n- Antiplatelets (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) \u2192 Stop 7 days before surgery (unless the patient has a recent stent or high thrombotic risk).\r\n\r\n- Warfarin, DOACs (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban) \u2192 Stop based on individual thrombotic and bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nDrugs that may be continued or adjusted perioperatively:\r\n\r\n- ACE inhibitors & ARBs (e.g., ramipril, valsartan) \u2192 Consider holding on the day of surgery to prevent hypotension.\r\n\r\n- Diuretics (e.g., indapamide, spironolactone) \u2192 Continue but monitor fluid balance.\r\n\r\n- Beta-blockers & Digoxin \u2192 Continue perioperatively unless there are concerns about renal function or toxicity.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

According to NICE NG153, the first-line oral antibiotic is:\r\n\r\nFlucloxacillin (due to its efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, the common pathogens in impetigo)\r\n\r\nThe usual course is 5 days, with extension to 7 days depending on response.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Topical hydrogen peroxide 1% cream \r\n\r\nFirst-line only for localised, non-bullous impetigo and in those who are not systemically unwell.\r\n\r\nNot appropriate for widespread or systemic infection.\r\n\r\nB) Topical fusidic acid \r\n\r\nAn option for localised impetigo if hydrogen peroxide is unsuitable or ineffective, but not appropriate for widespread/systemic involvement.\r\n\r\nD) Oral clarithromycin \r\n\r\nRecommended only in patients with penicillin allergy.\r\n\r\nNot first-line in this patient who has no reported allergy.\r\n\r\nE) Oral co-amoxiclav \r\n\r\nBroader-spectrum than necessary.\r\n\r\nReserved for complicated cases or where other first-line treatments fail or are unsuitable.\r\n\r\nOveruse increases antimicrobial resistance risk.\r\n\r\nManaging Widespread or Systemic Impetigo:\r\n\r\nImpetigo is a highly contagious superficial bacterial skin infection, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. In patients with localised impetigo, topical treatments such as hydrogen peroxide 1% cream or fusidic acid may suffice.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the infection is widespread or the patient is systemically unwell, topical treatments are insufficient. In such cases, oral antibiotics are recommended, with flucloxacillin as the first-line choice for patients who do not have penicillin allergies. Alternatives like clarithromycin or erythromycin (for pregnant women) are reserved for those intolerant to penicillins.\r\n\r\nEarly initiation of appropriate treatment reduces transmission risk, promotes resolution, and helps prevent complications such as cellulitis.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 35-year-old man is diagnosed with cranial diabetes insipidus after suffering a head injury. He produces about 6 litres of urine per day and has severe thirst.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Desmopressin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCranial (or central) diabetes insipidus occurs due to a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, typically following head trauma, neurosurgery, or brain injury. This leads to excessive urine production (polyuria) and intense thirst (polydipsia). Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of ADH that selectively acts on renal V2 receptors to promote water reabsorption in the kidneys. It effectively reduces urine volume and thirst.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Carbamazepine is used for partial seizures and sometimes for neuropathic pain. It has some mild antidiuretic effects but is not first-line for diabetes insipidus\r\n\r\nB) Demeclocycline is used in the treatment of SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion), not diabetes insipidus\r\n\r\nD) Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist used for hyponatraemia in SIADH, not for ADH deficiency\r\n\r\nE) Vasopressin itself has a short duration of action and also causes vasoconstriction, making desmopressin the safer and more appropriate choice\r\n\r\n\r\nDesmopressin is the first-line treatment for cranial diabetes insipidus because it replaces the missing ADH, effectively controls symptoms, and has a longer and more predictable action than natural vasopressin.",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nD) Pioglitazone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is contraindicated in patients with active or a history of bladder cancer, as well as in those with unexplained macroscopic haematuria. The MHRA has issued safety warnings about the increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone.

No known association with bladder cancer, though caution is advised with genitourinary infections.\r\n\r\nB) Dapagliflozin\r\n\r\nAlso an SGLT2 inhibitor. Initial concerns regarding bladder cancer were not confirmed in later data, so it is not contraindicated.\r\n\r\nC) Empagliflozin \r\n\r\nAnother SGLT2 inhibitor.

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) 12.5 mg once daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAlogliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor used to manage blood glucose in type 2 diabetes, often alongside metformin or other agents.\r\nIt is primarily renally excreted, so dosing must be adjusted according to renal function.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for alogliptin:\r\n\r\n- eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 \u2192 25 mg once daily (standard dose)\r\n- eGFR 30\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 \u2192 12.5 mg once daily\r\n- eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 \u2192 6.25 mg once daily\r\n\r\nThis patient\u2019s eGFR is 35, which places him in the moderate renal impairment range, so the appropriate dose is 12.5 mg once daily.\r\n\r\nAlogliptin and Renal Impairment:\r\n\r\nAlogliptin is a once-daily oral anti-diabetic that inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme, increasing incretin levels and helping regulate glucose in type 2 diabetes. Because it is renally eliminated, patients with reduced eGFR require dose adjustments to prevent drug accumulation and minimise the risk of side effects.\r\n\r\nPer the SmPC and BNF, a patient with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30\u201359) should receive 12.5 mg once daily, while those with severe impairment (<30) require further reduction to 6.25 mg daily. Monitoring renal function regularly is key to ensuring safe and effective use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson BNF Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: A) Rinsing the mouth with water immediately after using the inhaler\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, oral candidiasis (thrush) and voice alteration (dysphonia) are common or very common side effects of inhaled corticosteroids, particularly fluticasone. These effects result from local deposition of the steroid in the oropharyngeal area. The most effective measure to prevent this is to rinse the mouth with water or brush the teeth immediately after using the inhaler. This reduces the amount of steroid residue in the mouth and throat, helping to prevent fungal overgrowth and irritation.\r\n\r\nUse of a spacer with an MDI (metered-dose inhaler) can further reduce deposition in the oropharynx and is often recommended in combination with mouth rinsing.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nB) Switching to a different type of inhaled corticosteroid \u2013 Not the most effective or first-line solution. Most ICS can cause thrush, and switching without other interventions may not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nC) Taking a probiotic supplement daily \u2013 Not evidence-based or recommended in asthma management or BNF for ICS-related thrush.\r\n\r\nD) Using a peak flow metre \u2013 Helps monitor asthma control, but does not reduce the risk of oral thrush.\r\n\r\nE) Using the inhaler at its highest effective dose \u2013 This could worsen local side effects. The goal should be the lowest effective dose to manage symptoms.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* ICS side effects like oral thrush can be reduced by rinsing the mouth or brushing teeth post-inhalation.\r\n* A spacer device can also help reduce local steroid deposition in the mouth and throat.\r\n* Patients should be educated on proper inhaler technique and hygiene to reduce preventable side effects\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nB) Antipsychotic drugs can cause serious adverse effects, such as increased mortality and cerebrovascular events.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAntipsychotics are associated with:\r\n\r\n- A significantly increased risk of stroke and transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs)\r\n\r\n- Increased all-cause mortality, particularly in elderly patients with dementia\r\n\r\n- Other risks: sedation, parkinsonism, falls, infections, and cognitive worsening\r\n\r\nTherefore, NICE strongly advises against routine use in dementia, except when:\r\n\r\n- The patient is experiencing persistent aggression, psychosis, or severe distress\r\n\r\n- AND is at immediate risk of harm to self or others\r\n\r\n- AND non-drug interventions have been tried and failed\r\n\r\n- Regular review (every 6 weeks minimum) is essential if antipsychotics are started.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Worsen cognition \r\n\r\nTrue, but not the main reason for avoidance.

    "text": "A 78-year-old woman is taking an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke due to atrial fibrillation. She has no other medical conditions or allergies. She is a non-smoker and has a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2. She has no family history of cardiovascular disease or venous thromboembolism (VTE).\r\n\r\nShe is admitted to the hospital with a severe intracranial haemorrhage. She took her last dose of the anticoagulant 6 hours ago.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC. Edoxaban\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nEdoxaban is a direct oral factor Xa inhibitor. Unlike apixaban and rivaroxaban, which can be reversed by andexanet alfa (Ondexxya), and dabigatran, which can be reversed by idarucizumab (Praxbind), edoxaban currently does not have a specific licensed reversal agent available in the UK. In emergency situations involving edoxaban-related bleeding, supportive measures such as activated charcoal (if ingestion was recent), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or tranexamic acid may be used off-label, but there is no dedicated antidote.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Apixaban\r\n\r\nApixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor. A specific reversal agent, andexanet alfa, is available and licensed in the UK to reverse apixaban in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.\r\n\r\nB. Dabigatran\r\n\r\nDabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor. It has a specific reversal agent, idarucizumab, which is available and effective in rapidly reversing its anticoagulant effects.\r\n\r\nD. Rivaroxaban\r\n\r\nLike apixaban, rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor. It also has a licensed reversal agent, andexanet alfa, available in the UK for severe bleeding events.\r\n\r\nE. Warfarin\r\n\r\nWarfarin is a vitamin K antagonist. It can be reversed using vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma depending on the severity of bleeding and urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll oral anticoagulants used in the UK except edoxaban have a specific licensed reversal agent. Dabigatran is reversed with idarucizumab, while apixaban and rivaroxaban are reversed with andexanet alfa. Warfarin is reversed with vitamin K or clotting factor replacement. In the case of edoxaban, only non-specific or supportive measures can currently be used, making its management in severe bleeding more complex.",

    "why": "E) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia\r\n\r\nCorrect Answer:\r\n\r\nE. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSpironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and potassium sparing diuretic. Ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, also reduces aldosterone secretion and promotes potassium retention.\r\nWhen combined, these drugs significantly increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with heart failure or renal impairment, both common in this demographic.\r\n\r\nHyperkalaemia can cause:\r\n\r\n- Muscle weakness\r\n\r\n- ECG changes\r\n\r\n- Life-threatening arrhythmias\r\n\r\n- Hence, potassium and renal function must be closely monitored, and patients must be counselled on signs of toxicity.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic \u2013 No antibiotics involved in this scenario.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant \u2013 Neither spironolactone nor ramipril reduces anticoagulant efficacy.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive \u2013 These drugs do not interfere with hormonal contraceptives.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of bleeding \u2013 This would be expected with NSAIDs, SSRIs, or anticoagulants, not ACE inhibitors or diuretics.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia \u2013 ACE inhibitors can rarely cause hypoglycaemia, but this combination doesn't increase that risk significantly.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension \u2013 While both drugs lower BP, they\u2019re often used together in heart failure. Hypotension can occur but is less clinically concerning than hyperkalaemia here.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome \u2013 Only applies to serotonergic agents (e.g. SSRIs, MAOIs, tramadol), not applicable here.\r\n\r\n\r\n- According to NICE NG106 (Chronic heart failure in adults):\r\n\r\n- Patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction should be offered ACE inhibitors (e.g. ramipril) and aldosterone antagonists (e.g. spironolactone) to improve survival.\r\n\r\n- However, this combination requires close monitoring due to increased risk of hyperkalaemia and renal dysfunction.\r\n\r\n- Baseline and regular monitoring of serum potassium and renal function is essential.\r\n\r\n- Stop or reduce the dose if potassium rises above safe limits (usually >5.5 mmol/L).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "B. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nSumatriptan is a selective serotonin receptor agonist (5HT1-receptor agonist) that induces vasoconstriction to alleviate migraines. However, it is contraindicated in patients with:\r\n\r\nCerebrovascular disease (e.g., history of transient ischaemic attack or stroke)\r\nCardiovascular conditions (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, or peripheral vascular disease)\r\nThis patient's history of TIA places her at an increased risk of adverse events from sumatriptan, such as cerebrovascular or cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, the co-prescription of fluoxetine requires caution due to the potential for serotonin syndrome, a rare but serious condition caused by excessive serotonergic activity.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nThese conditions are not contraindications for sumatriptan. However, patients with significant respiratory disease should always be monitored when taking new medications.\r\n\r\nC. Concomitant use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets\r\n\r\nSumatriptan does not interact significantly with anticoagulants or antiplatelets. However, the underlying condition for which these medications are prescribed may be relevant (e.g., history of stroke or TIA).\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia\r\n\r\nDiabetes is not a contraindication for sumatriptan. However, patients with diabetes and long-standing vascular disease may be at increased risk of cardiovascular complications.\r\n\r\nE. History of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nSumatriptan does not have a direct association with gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, making this an unrelated option in this scenario.\r\n\r\nF. Liver disease or alcoholism\r\n\r\nLiver impairment can affect the metabolism of sumatriptan, necessitating dose adjustments in severe cases. However, this is not applicable to this patient.\r\n\r\nG. Pregnancy and lactation\r\n\r\nWhile sumatriptan is not contraindicated in pregnancy, its use should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks. It is compatible with breastfeeding, with precautions.\r\n\r\nH. Severe renal impairment\r\n\r\nWhile dose adjustments are necessary in renal impairment, this is not relevant to this patient.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines for managing migraines, triptans like sumatriptan are recommended as first-line therapy for acute migraine attacks. However, they are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease due to their vasoconstrictive properties. Clinicians must assess each patient's medical history to determine the safest treatment option, particularly when multiple comorbidities are present.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE. Warfarin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWarfarin is the anticoagulant of choice for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had a venous thrombotic event, such as a DVT. According to BNF, MHRA guidance, and the British Society for Haematology, DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban are not recommended in patients with APS, particularly in those with high-risk features or a history of thrombotic events.\r\n\r\nThis is due to evidence showing an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis with DOACs in this population. The MHRA issued a safety alert in 2019 advising prescribers to avoid DOACs in patients with confirmed APS, especially those who are triple positive (positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I antibodies).\r\n\r\nFor patients like this woman, the recommended INR target is 2.5 (range 2.0\u20133.0) if the thrombosis was venous.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Apixaban\r\n\r\nThis DOAC is not suitable for APS patients due to insufficient evidence of safety and an increased risk of recurrence. It is contraindicated in high-risk APS.\r\n\r\nB. Dabigatran\r\n\r\nAs a direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran is also not recommended for APS. It has not been shown to be as effective as warfarin in preventing recurrence in this patient group.\r\n\r\nC. Edoxaban\r\n\r\nThis factor Xa inhibitor is not approved for use in APS. Like the other DOACs, it is associated with higher recurrence rates and is contraindicated based on MHRA guidance.\r\n\r\nD. Rivaroxaban\r\n\r\nRivaroxaban was the DOAC studied in the TRAPS trial, which demonstrated increased thrombotic events in high-risk APS patients. It is specifically contraindicated in this condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome and a history of venous thrombosis should be treated with long-term warfarin, targeting an INR of 2.5. DOACs should be avoided due to their association with higher recurrence risk in APS. This is supported by BNF, MHRA guidance, and haematology expert consensus.",

Increasing could worsen side effects.\r\n\r\nD) She should stop taking duloxetine immediately and see her GP for further advice\r\n\r\n\u2192 Stopping abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms. Stopping is not warranted unless side effects are severe or unmanageable.\r\n\r\nE) The symptoms described are not known to be caused by duloxetine\r\n\r\n\u2192 Incorrect. All of her symptoms (dry mouth, constipation, insomnia) are well-documented adverse effects of duloxetine.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Duloxetine 60 mg is a first-line treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain.\r\n\r\n- Common early side effects include dry mouth, constipation, insomnia, and nausea.\r\n\r\n- Advice: Continue taking it as prescribed; symptoms often resolve within a few weeks.\r\n\r\n- Encourage good hydration, high-fibre diet, and sleep hygiene.\r\n\r\n- Review with GP only if symptoms persist beyond 2\u20133 weeks or become intolerable.",

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nD. Refer the patient back to the prescriber to switch the drug to an alternative agent\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nACE inhibitors (ACEIs), such as ramipril, are commonly associated with a persistent dry cough due to their effect on bradykinin accumulation. According to NICE guidelines, if the cough becomes troublesome, the ACEI should be discontinued and substituted with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) such as losartan or candesartan. Since this patient has been taking ramipril for three weeks and the cough is persistent, referral to the prescriber for a medication switch is the most appropriate action.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Reassure the patient that the symptoms described are likely to resolve without intervention\r\n\r\nThe cough caused by ACEIs does not usually resolve while the medication is continued. Stopping the medication is the only effective solution.\r\n\r\nB. Refer the patient back to the prescriber as they may require a dose increase\r\n\r\nIncreasing the dose would not resolve the cough and might worsen it.\r\n\r\nC. Refer the patient back to the prescriber as they may require a dose reduction\r\n\r\nReducing the dose may not eliminate the cough, as even low doses can cause this side effect.\r\n\r\nE. Sell an over-the-counter product and ask them to return if the symptoms have not gone within 1 week\r\n\r\nCough suppressants do not treat ACEI-induced cough. They may provide temporary relief, but the cough will persist until the medication is stopped.\r\n\r\nF. Sell an over-the-counter product and ask them to return if the symptoms have not gone within 3 weeks\r\n\r\nThe approach remains ineffective, as symptom management alone will not address the cause.\r\n\r\nG. Submit a Yellow Card report detailing the nature of the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms\r\n\r\nWhile the Yellow Card scheme is used for reporting adverse drug reactions, ACEI-induced cough is a well-known side effect, so it does not require mandatory reporting.\r\n\r\nH. Take the patient's blood pressure to help inform your final course of action\r\n\r\nBlood pressure monitoring is important for hypertension management, but in this case, it does not directly address the cough, which is the patient's primary concern.\r\n\r\nACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, but up to 10% of patients develop a persistent dry cough. NICE guidelines recommend switching to an ARB if the cough is problematic. ARBs, such as losartan or candesartan, are equally effective in lowering blood pressure without causing bradykinin-related cough. When switching, it is important to monitor renal function, potassium levels, and blood pressure to ensure a safe transition.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 45-year-old patient with a history of depression is due to start on an SSRI. The patient also has a known history of QT interval prolongation.",
    "why": "C. Citalopram\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nCitalopram is known to prolong the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner. This prolongation of the QT interval can increase the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. For this reason, citalopram should be avoided in patients with known QT interval prolongation. The NICE guidelines advise caution when prescribing citalopram to individuals with this condition, and recommend avoiding it if possible.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Fluoxetine: Some evidence suggests fluoxetine may prolong the QT interval, but the risk is less established than citalopram. It\u2019s generally considered safer, though caution is advised in patients with a history of QT prolongation.\r\n\r\nB. Sertraline: Sertraline has a weaker association with QT prolongation compared to citalopram, making it a safer option for patients with a history of QT interval prolongation.\r\n\r\nD. Paroxetine: Paroxetine is not associated with QT prolongation and is considered safe for patients with QT interval prolongation, though individual factors should be considered.\r\n\r\nE. Venlafaxine: As an SNRI, venlafaxine is not linked to QT prolongation and is generally safe in such patients. However, blood pressure monitoring is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, QT interval prolongation is a known risk with certain SSRIs and SNRIs, particularly citalopram and escitalopram, which should be avoided in patients with a known history of QT interval prolongation. When prescribing SSRIs, careful consideration must be given to individual risk factors, including cardiac history, as the prolongation of the QT interval can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. If an SSRI is deemed necessary, alternatives like sertraline or fluoxetine may be considered, although monitoring is recommended, especially if the patient has additional risk factors for QT prolongation. The use of other antidepressants, such as paroxetine or venlafaxine, may be more suitable in such cases, as they are not commonly associated with QT prolongation. Regular monitoring of the ECG and appropriate dose adjustments are important when prescribing any antidepressant to patients with a history of QT prolongation.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "The patient has been on more than 40 mg prednisolone daily for more than 1 week.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in patients who:\r\n\r\nHave been on systemic corticosteroids for more than 3 weeks.\r\nHave received doses greater than 40 mg prednisolone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week.\r\nHave recently received repeated courses of systemic corticosteroids.\r\nMay have developed adrenal suppression due to prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\r\nCorticosteroids suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and sudden discontinuation in patients receiving high doses or long-term therapy can result in adrenal insufficiency, which is potentially life-threatening. Gradual tapering allows the HPA axis to recover and resume normal cortisol production.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: The patient has been on less than 40 mg prednisolone daily for more than 1 week.\r\n\r\nGradual withdrawal may not be required if the patient has been on low doses (<40 mg) for a short duration, as adrenal suppression is less likely in this scenario.\r\n\r\nB: The patient has been on more than 40 mg prednisolone daily for less than 1 week.\r\n\r\nShort-term corticosteroid use (<1 week) at high doses typically does not require tapering, as adrenal suppression is unlikely to develop in such a short period.\r\n\r\nD: The patient has been on less than 40 mg prednisolone daily for less than 1 week.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Option A, adrenal suppression is not expected with low-dose, short-term corticosteroid use, so tapering is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nE: The patient has been on 40 mg prednisolone daily for exactly 1 week.\r\n\r\nA dose of exactly 40 mg for 1 week falls just below the threshold for requiring tapering, as adrenal suppression is unlikely to be significant.\r\n\r\nSystemic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, can cause suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when used at high doses or for prolonged periods. According to the BNF and NICE guidelines, gradual withdrawal is required in patients who have received:\r\n\r\nMore than 40 mg prednisolone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week.\r\nLong-term corticosteroid therapy (typically >3 weeks).\r\nRepeated courses of corticosteroids or high cumulative doses.\r\nGradual tapering reduces the risk of adrenal insufficiency, which can present with fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycaemia. Patients on prolonged therapy should be counselled to never stop corticosteroids abruptly without medical advice. Steroid treatment cards should be provided to patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy to ensure healthcare professionals are aware of their treatment in emergencies.\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Sacubitril/valsartan\r\n\r\nSacubitril/valsartan could replace the ACE inhibitor if a switch were warranted, but this would not specifically address the elevated heart rate.\r\n\r\nH. Spironolactone\r\n\r\nThe patient is already on an aldosterone antagonist, so adding another would not provide additional benefit.\r\n\r\nIndications for Ivabradine in HFrEF:\r\n\r\nResting heart rate \u226575 bpm despite optimised beta-blocker therapy.\r\n\r\nPersistent symptoms despite optimal treatment with ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, loop diuretic, and aldosterone antagonist.\r\n\r\nIvabradine reduces hospitalisations for worsening heart failure without affecting blood pressure or myocardial contractility.\r\n\r\nAlways assess for contraindications to further heart rate reduction before initiating ivabradine.\r\n\r\nThis targeted approach ensures that the patient receives the most appropriate therapy based on their clinical status and unmet treatment needs.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Every 24 hours\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe Hartford nomogram helps determine the optimal dosing interval for gentamicin based on the patient\u2019s renal function and serum drug concentrations.\r\n\r\nThe serum gentamicin concentration (0.8 mg/L) measured 12 hours after infusion lies within the safe trough range (<1 mg/L).\r\nUsing the Hartford nomogram, plotting the concentration (horizontal axis) against the time since the infusion (vertical axis) indicates a dosing interval of every 24 hours.\r\nThis ensures effective antibiotic activity while minimising the risk of toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity, associated with higher trough levels.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Every 8 hours\r\n\r\nThis frequency is too short and risks accumulating gentamicin levels above the recommended trough concentration (<1 mg/L), leading to potential toxicity.\r\n\r\nB. Every 12 hours\r\n\r\nWhile this interval may seem appropriate based on a relatively low trough level, the Hartford nomogram confirms that every 24 hours is safer and more effective for this patient.\r\n\r\nC. Every 18 hours\r\n\r\nNot typically used in practice for gentamicin dosing, as standard intervals (e.g., 8, 12, or 24 hours) are preferred for simplicity and consistency in monitoring.\r\n\r\nE. Every 36 hours\r\n\r\nThis interval is too long and risks subtherapeutic gentamicin levels, which could compromise treatment efficacy, especially in severe infections like listerial meningitis.\r\n\r\nNICE emphasises the importance of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for aminoglycosides like gentamicin to optimise efficacy and minimise toxicity.\r\n\r\nPeak levels (5\u201310 mg/L): Ensure the drug reaches effective bactericidal concentrations.\r\nTrough levels (<1 mg/L): Reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.\r\nOnce-daily dosing: Preferred in most cases for simplicity and to maximise the post-antibiotic effect.\r\nFor listerial meningitis, gentamicin is often used as an adjunct to beta-lactam antibiotics. Regular monitoring of renal function and drug levels is critical, particularly in younger patients where renal function might allow for a standard 24-hour interval.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections): \r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She is admitted to the hospital and blood tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA. Acute liver failure due to itraconazole hepatotoxicity.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nItraconazole is a systemic triazole antifungal that is known to cause hepatotoxicity, including rare but serious cases of acute liver failure, sometimes even after a single dose.\r\n\r\nThe patient presents with:\r\n\r\n- Acute onset of symptoms following itraconazole ingestion\r\n\r\n- Typical features of liver injury: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice\r\n\r\n- LFT derangement: raised liver enzymes and bilirubin\r\n\r\n- These clinical findings point strongly to drug-induced liver injury (DILI), most likely caused by itraconazole hepatotoxicity.\r\n\r\nMHRA and BNF warn that patients on itraconazole must be counselled to report:\r\n\r\n- Dark urine\r\n\r\n- Pale stools\r\n\r\n- Jaundice\r\n\r\n- Abdominal pain\r\n\r\n- Fatigue\r\n\r\nThese signs may suggest life-threatening hepatic injury, and early withdrawal is essential.\r\n\r\nExplanation Of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Acute cholecystitis due to itraconazole-induced gallstones\r\n\r\n- Itraconazole is not associated with gallstone formation or cholecystitis.\r\n\r\n- Cholecystitis presents with RUQ pain, fever, and Murphy\u2019s sign, not jaundice with hepatocellular injury.\r\n\r\n- No clinical or pharmacological link supports gallbladder inflammation from itraconazole.\r\n\r\nC. Acute pancreatitis due to itraconazole-induced hypertriglyceridaemia\r\n\r\n- Pancreatitis would present with epigastric pain radiating to the back and raised amylase/lipase.\r\n\r\n- Itraconazole does not significantly raise triglycerides or cause pancreatitis.\r\n\r\n- The presence of jaundice and raised bilirubin rules this out.\r\n\r\nD. Acute hepatitis A infection due to contaminated itraconazole capsules\r\n\r\n- Hepatitis A has an incubation period of 2\u20136 weeks.\r\n\r\n- Symptoms would not occur immediately after the first dose.\r\n\r\n- No evidence of widespread contamination; highly unlikely cause.\r\n\r\nE. Acute haemolytic anaemia due to G6PD deficiency\r\n\r\n- Presents with dark urine, pallor, fatigue, and anaemia-related symptoms, not raised liver enzymes.\r\n\r\n- Itraconazole is not a classic trigger for G6PD-related haemolysis.\r\n\r\n- Jaundice from haemolysis is pre-hepatic (with normal liver enzymes), not hepatocellular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItraconazole can cause serious hepatotoxicity, even after short-term use: \r\n\r\n- Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice, and elevated LFTs.\r\n\r\n- It is crucial to counsel patients to report liver-related symptoms immediately.\r\n\r\n- Healthcare professionals should consider baseline LFTs and close monitoring if treatment is prolonged.\r\n\r\n- Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a key differential when symptoms appear after a new medication.",

Both lower blood glucose through different mechanisms, and when used together, they significantly increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, especially in patients with a low or well-controlled HbA1c (as seen here with 47 mmol/mol).\r\n\r\nAlthough sitagliptin monotherapy carries a low risk of hypoglycaemia, combining it with sulfonylureas like gliclazide potentiates that risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic \r\n\r\nNo antibiotics are listed. None of the listed drugs significantly affect antibiotic absorption.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant \r\n\r\nNo anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, DOACs) are prescribed.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive \r\n\r\nNo enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine) are present to reduce contraceptive efficacy.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of bleeding \r\n\r\nNo antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or NSAIDs are prescribed.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia \r\n\r\nNo ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, or potassium supplements.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension \r\n\r\nNo antihypertensives or vasodilators are prescribed.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome \r\n\r\nNo serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, MAOIs, tramadol) are included.\r\n\r\nGliclazide & Sitagliptin Interaction:\r\n\r\nGliclazide is a sulfonylurea that increases insulin release from the pancreas, while sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that enhances endogenous incretin hormones to lower glucose levels. When used together, their glucose-lowering effects are additive, increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia, especially when the patient has well-controlled diabetes. Clinicians should counsel patients on recognising hypoglycaemia symptoms and consider dose reduction of sulfonylureas if necessary.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://www.preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She is a non-smoker and has a body mass index (BMI) of 26 kg/m2. She has no family history of cardiovascular disease or venous thromboembolism (VTE).\r\n\r\nShe is prescribed hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. She wants to know if she can take this drug with amiodarone.",
    "why": "E: She should avoid taking hydroxychloroquine with amiodarone unless other antiarrhythmic or antirheumatic drugs are not suitable.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nBoth amiodarone and hydroxychloroquine are associated with QT interval prolongation, which increases the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. According to the British National Formulary (BNF), the co-administration of two QT-prolonging drugs should be avoided unless no suitable alternatives are available. If the combination is deemed necessary, the patient must be closely monitored, including regular ECGs to track QT interval changes and assessments of electrolytes (e.g., potassium and magnesium).\r\n\r\nThis combination should only be used with extreme caution, and patients must be educated about recognising symptoms of arrhythmias, such as palpitations, dizziness, fainting, or seizures. If any of these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is required. By avoiding the combination where possible, the risk of potentially fatal cardiac events can be minimised.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: She can take hydroxychloroquine with amiodarone without any precautions.\r\n\r\nThis ignores the significant risk of QT prolongation and provides no safety measures for the patient.\r\n\r\nB: She can take hydroxychloroquine with amiodarone but she should monitor her heart rate regularly.\r\n\r\nWhile monitoring heart rate is helpful, it does not address the critical risk of QT interval prolongation, which requires ECG monitoring.\r\n\r\nC: She can take hydroxychloroquine with amiodarone but she should have regular blood tests to check her liver function.\r\n\r\nMonitoring liver function is important for both drugs but does not mitigate the main risk of QT prolongation.\r\n\r\nD: She should stop taking amiodarone before starting hydroxychloroquine and use an alternative antiarrhythmic drug.\r\n\r\nDiscontinuing amiodarone might not be appropriate without consulting her cardiologist, especially if it is essential for managing her atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQT Prolongation with Amiodarone and Hydroxychloroquine:\r\n\r\nMechanism: Both drugs delay cardiac repolarisation, leading to QT prolongation.\r\n\r\nRisks: Increased risk of torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death when used together.\r\n\r\nMonitoring and Patient Safety:\r\n\r\nAvoid combination unless necessary.\r\n\r\nMonitor via ECG and check electrolytes.\r\n\r\nEducate patients on warning symptoms of arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: Safer antiarrhythmic or antirheumatic therapies should be explored if possible.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures patient safety while addressing the therapeutic goals for both conditions.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a (eGFR 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2) is prescribed canagliflozin 100 mg once daily in addition to metformin and insulin.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for canaglifozin has been provided for this question.  [SmPC for Canagliflozin](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8855/smpc)",
    "why": "C. Maintain at 100 mg once daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a 67-year-old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD stage 3a (eGFR 45\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2), the recommended dose of canagliflozin is 100 mg once daily, as per the SmPC. This dose balances efficacy for glycaemic control and renoprotection while minimising the risk of adverse effects, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the dose to 300 mg is not appropriate for patients with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 due to reduced glycaemic efficacy and heightened risk of side effects.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Discontinue canagliflozin\r\n\r\nDiscontinuation is not necessary, as canagliflozin provides renoprotective and glycaemic control benefits even in CKD stage 3a. Discontinuation is only advised if the eGFR drops below 30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 (except in specific cases of nephropathy).\r\n\r\nB. Increase to 300 mg once daily\r\n\r\nAn increase to 300 mg is only suitable for patients with an eGFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 who require tighter glycaemic control. For eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2, 300 mg is not recommended due to safety concerns.\r\n\r\nD. No dose adjustment is needed\r\n\r\nThis answer is misleading. While no adjustment from the 100 mg dose is needed, it ignores the fact that higher doses (300 mg) are contraindicated in this patient population.\r\n\r\nE. Reduce to 50 mg once daily\r\n\r\nA 50 mg dose is not an approved or available strength for canagliflozin.\r\n\r\nCanagliflozin Use in CKD Stage 3a\r\nCanagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, is effective in improving glycaemic control and offers renoprotective benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Dose adjustments are guided by the patient\u2019s renal function:\r\n\r\neGFR \u226560 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2: Canagliflozin can be titrated up to 300 mg if required.\r\neGFR 45\u201359 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2: Maintain or adjust to 100 mg once daily.\r\neGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2: Canagliflozin is typically discontinued unless there is significant albuminuria or nephrologist oversight.\r\nPatients should be monitored for signs of volume depletion, electrolyte imbalances, or hypoglycaemia if used with insulin or insulin secretagogues.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past 2 days and she started canagliflozin 100mg tablets last week, which were prescribed by her diabetic nurse.\u00a0\r\nThe SmPC for canaglifozin has been provided for this question.  [SmPC for Canagliflozin](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8855/smpc)",
    "why": "B. Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs), including symptoms such as painful urination, are classified as a common side effect of Canagliflozin (\u22651/100 to <1/10). This is due to the increased glucose levels in the urine caused by the mechanism of action of Canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which promotes glycosuria. The glucose-rich environment creates a breeding ground for bacteria, leading to an increased risk of UTIs. In severe cases, complications such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis have been reported. The patient should be referred to her GP for further evaluation and potential treatment.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Very common (\u22651/10):\r\n\r\nGenital infections, such as balanitis or vulvovaginal candidiasis, are very common side effects of Canagliflozin. However, UTIs fall into the common category.\r\n\r\nC. Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100):\r\n\r\nAdverse effects like dehydration or hypotension may occur infrequently with Canagliflozin, but UTIs are more frequent.\r\n\r\nD. Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000):\r\n\r\nRare side effects include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), but UTIs occur more frequently.\r\n\r\nE. Very rare (<1/10,000):\r\n\r\nSerious allergic reactions or severe skin reactions are very rare. Painful urination due to a UTI is more common.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, SGLT2 inhibitors such as Canagliflozin are associated with an increased risk of UTIs due to their glycosuric effect. Patients starting Canagliflozin should be counselled on recognising signs of infection, including painful urination, urgency, or fever, and advised to seek medical attention promptly. Pharmacists should ensure patients understand the importance of good personal hygiene and adequate hydration to reduce the risk of infections.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Her father is concerned that her asthma is affecting her growth and development.",
    "why": "Correct answer: A) Add paediatric dose fluticasone\r\n\r\nRationale:\u2028According to NICE guidelines, for children aged 5 years and under with suspected or confirmed asthma, a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) should be trialled for 8 weeks if the child:\r\n* Has had one or more severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids\r\n* Has symptoms more than three times per week\r\n* Is waking at night because of asthma symptoms\r\n\r\nIn this case, the child meets criteria due to persistent daytime symptoms and parental concern regarding growth. A paediatric dose of fluticasone is a safe and effective option that helps reduce inflammation and control symptoms.\r\n\r\nNote: AIR (Anti-inflammatory Reliever) and MART (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) regimens are recommended by NICE only for children aged 12 years and over, even though the licensed inhalers are approved for patients aged 18 and above.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Add paediatric dose montelukast \u2013 Incorrect. While montelukast may be considered if ICS is not tolerated or as an add-on, it is not recommended as the initial step.\r\n\r\nC) Add paediatric dose salmeterol \u2013 Incorrect. LABAs like salmeterol are not recommended in children under 5 due to limited data and safety concerns.\r\n\r\nD) Add paediatric dose theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. Theophylline is not appropriate as initial treatment in young children.\r\n\r\nE) Add paediatric dose tiotropium \u2013 Incorrect. Tiotropium is a LAMA reserved for older children with more severe or persistent asthma and is not recommended in this age group.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* For children under 5, a low-dose ICS (e.g. fluticasone) is first-line for persistent or frequent asthma symptoms.\r\n* Use a spacer with a facemask to improve medication delivery in young children.\r\n* Montelukast can be considered if ICS is not tolerated or as step-up therapy.\r\n* AIR/MART therapy is only recommended from age 12 onwards by NICE, even though the combination inhalers are licensed from age 18.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He is also given morphine 10 mg every 4 hours by subcutaneous injection for pain relief. After the second dose of gentamicin, he develops flushing, itching, urticaria, and shortness of breath.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nD) Histamine related reaction to gentamicin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, can sometimes contain residual histamine from the manufacturing process. When this happens, especially in patients already on histamine-releasing drugs like morphine, it can trigger a histamine related reaction.\r\n\r\n- The patient's symptoms, flushing, itching, urticaria, and shortness of breath, are typical of histamine mediated reactions, not true IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n\r\n- Symptoms occurred after the second dose, aligning with histamine related reactions to drug accumulation.\r\n\r\n- Morphine may have contributed but is not the primary cause, as the reaction occurred specifically after gentamicin administration.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Anaphylactic reaction to gentamicin\r\n\r\nWould typically occur immediately after administration and is rare for gentamicin. Also involves hypotension and potential collapse, which are not reported here.\r\n\r\nB) Anaphylactoid reaction to morphine\r\n\r\nMorphine can cause non-IgE-mediated histamine release, but the timing suggests gentamicin is more likely.\r\n\r\nC) Drug interaction between gentamicin and morphine\r\n\r\nThere is no direct interaction between gentamicin and morphine that would explain this reaction.\r\n\r\nE) Histamine-related reaction to morphine\r\n\r\nWhile morphine can release histamine, the reaction followed gentamicin administration, making gentamicin the more likely trigger in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a histamine-mediated reaction to gentamicin, likely due to residual histamine in the formulation, exacerbated by concurrent opioid use.

Her blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg. Her ECG shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 104 bpm.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB. Bisoprolol and digoxin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to BNF and NICE guidelines, if monotherapy fails to control ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a combination of any two of the following can be used for rate control:\r\n\r\n- A beta-blocker\r\n\r\n- A calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem)\r\n\r\n- Digoxin\r\n\r\n- Digoxin is particularly helpful in combination with beta-blockers like bisoprolol in older patients or those who are largely sedentary, where digoxin\u2019s parasympathetic action complements the beta-blocker\u2019s sympathetic inhibition.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Bisoprolol and amiodarone\r\n\r\nNot appropriate \u2013 Amiodarone is primarily used for rhythm control, not rate control. It carries significant risks including pulmonary, thyroid, and hepatic toxicity, and is typically reserved for rhythm-control in selected cases. Combining it with bisoprolol may also increase the risk of bradycardia.\r\n\r\nC. Bisoprolol and diltiazem\r\n\r\nNot suitable \u2013 Both bisoprolol (a beta-blocker) and diltiazem (a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker) act on the AV node and can cause additive bradycardia, hypotension, and heart block. This combination is contraindicated in many cases due to risk of severe conduction abnormalities.\r\n\r\nD. Bisoprolol and sotalol\r\n\r\nInappropriate \u2013 Sotalol has both beta-blocking and anti-arrhythmic properties (Class III). Using it alongside another beta-blocker like bisoprolol is redundant and unsafe, increasing risk of QT prolongation, bradycardia, and torsades de pointes.\r\n\r\nE. Bisoprolol and verapamil\r\n\r\nUnsafe \u2013 Verapamil is also a rate-limiting calcium-channel blocker, and combining it with bisoprolol may cause profound bradycardia, hypotension, and AV block. This combination is specifically contraindicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor patients with AF who remain tachycardic on monotherapy, the combination of bisoprolol and digoxin is an effective and appropriate rate-control strategy. This pairing is supported by BNF and NICE, especially in elderly or less active patients. Other combinations like bisoprolol with diltiazem or verapamil are contraindicated due to additive bradycardia risk.",

He experiences a severe episode of chest pain and uses his spray twice in 5 minute intervals. However, he does not get any relief and wonders if he should use another dose.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nB) He should call 999 immediately and not use any more glyceryl trinitrate spray\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE and Resuscitation Council guidance, if a patient with angina uses glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray and the pain persists after two doses taken five minutes apart, this could signal an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). Further delay in seeking emergency care may be dangerous. The correct action is to call 999 immediately, stop using GTN, and await further medical advice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patient is using sildenafil, which is contraindicated with nitrates due to the risk of profound hypotension. Continued GTN use could worsen his condition.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) He can use another dose of glyceryl trinitrate spray after 5 minutes if the pain persists\r\n\r\nNICE advises seeking emergency help if chest pain is not relieved after 2 doses, each 5 minutes apart. Using more GTN could delay necessary treatment and cause hypotension, especially risky when sildenafil is involved.\r\n\r\nC) He should stop taking sildenafil and use another dose of glyceryl trinitrate spray after 15 minutes if the pain persists\r\n\r\nDiscontinuing sildenafil is a good long-term step if using nitrates, but this does not address the immediate emergency. Waiting another 15 minutes risks further damage if this is a myocardial infarction.\r\n\r\nD) He should take an aspirin 300 mg tablet and use another dose of glyceryl trinitrate spray after 10 minutes if the pain persists\r\n\r\nAspirin 300 mg is indeed appropriate in suspected MI, but this is not a substitute for emergency care. Waiting again could delay life-saving intervention.\r\n\r\nE) He should lie down and rest and use another dose of glyceryl trinitrate spray after 20 minutes if the pain persists\r\n\r\nThis advice is inappropriate and unsafe. Waiting longer without medical input could result in serious harm or death in the context of a potential MI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf chest pain persists after two doses of GTN spray taken 5 minutes apart, the patient must stop using the spray and call 999 immediately.

    "why": "A) Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDiazepam is a benzodiazepine with well-documented side effects, including sedation and drowsiness, especially when used pre-operatively. These effects are predictable and occur as part of the drug\u2019s pharmacological profile. According to MHRA guidance and NICE recommendations, adverse reactions that are well-known and included in the drug\u2019s Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) do not need to be reported to the Yellow Card Scheme unless they are unusually severe, persistent, or unexpected in nature.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Report: Black triangle medicine \u2013 Diazepam is not a black triangle medicine; it has an established safety profile and has been in use for many years.\r\n\r\nC) Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction \u2013 The drowsiness occurred as expected shortly after taking the medication, not in a delayed manner.\r\n\r\nD) Report: Herbal or Homoeopathic medicine \u2013 Diazepam is a conventional medicine, not a herbal or homoeopathic product.\r\n\r\nE) Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction \u2013 While drowsiness may be unpleasant, it does not constitute a serious or life-threatening reaction in this context.\r\n\r\nF) Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine \u2013 There is no indication that the diazepam was counterfeit or defective.\r\n\r\nG) Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine \u2013 The medicine was taken as prescribed for a specific indication, with no evidence of misuse.\r\n\r\nH) Report: Vaccine reaction \u2013 This scenario does not involve a vaccine.\r\n\r\nSevere drowsiness is a common side effect of diazepam, particularly in its use as a sedative.

It is only indicated if the patient has a sinus rhythm with a heart rate \u226575 bpm.\r\n\r\nF: Losartan\r\n\r\nLosartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and is an alternative to ACE inhibitors; however, ARBs can also cause angioedema, so they are contraindicated in this patient.\r\n\r\nG: Sacubitril/Valsartan\r\n\r\nSacubitril/valsartan (ARNI) is an alternative to ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but it is also contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema due to the risk of recurrence.\r\n\r\nH: Spironolactone\r\n\r\nSpironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, which the patient is already taking, so adding another dose would not be beneficial.\r\n\r\nFor patients with HFrEF, NICE NG106 recommends ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line therapy in combination with beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists (e.g., spironolactone). However, for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs due to angioedema, the recommended alternative is hydralazine combined with isosorbide dinitrate. This regimen has been shown to reduce mortality and improve heart failure symptoms, particularly in patients of African or Caribbean descent.\r\n\r\nThe treatment plan should be regularly reviewed, and patients should be monitored for hypotension, headache, and dizziness, which are common side effects of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. If symptoms persist, specialist referral to a cardiologist may be required for further optimisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 45-year-old woman comes to your pharmacy with a prescription for amoxicillin 500 mg capsules, to be taken three times a day for seven days for a chest infection. She tells you that she has a history of penicillin allergy, which causes her to develop a rash and itching. She says that she has taken amoxicillin before without any problems, and she does not want to change her antibiotic.",
    "why": "E. Refuse to dispense the prescription and refer her back to the prescriber for an alternative antibiotic.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPenicillin allergy, even if previously mild, such as a rash or itching, poses a risk of more severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, with repeated exposure. NICE guidelines advise avoiding penicillin and related beta-lactam antibiotics in such cases. Even though the patient reports no issues with amoxicillin previously, her documented allergy indicates a potential risk. By referring her back to the prescriber, you ensure she receives an effective and safe alternative, such as clarithromycin or doxycycline, without compromising her safety. This also allows an opportunity to reinforce the importance of avoiding penicillin-containing antibiotics in the future.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Dispense the prescription as written and advise her to report any side effects to the Yellow Card scheme.\r\n\r\nThis is inappropriate because dispensing a medication the patient is allergic to can lead to severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Reporting side effects does not prevent immediate risks.\r\n\r\nB. Dispense the prescription with a warning label and advise her to stop taking the antibiotic and seek medical attention if she develops any signs of anaphylaxis.\r\n\r\nAlthough this option addresses potential side effects, it does not mitigate the risk of administering a contraindicated medication. Anaphylaxis can occur unpredictably, requiring avoidance of penicillin altogether.\r\n\r\nC. Dispense the prescription with an antihistamine and advise her to take it as needed for the rash and itching.\r\n\r\nThis option overlooks the potential for severe allergic reactions. Antihistamines cannot prevent or treat anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical intervention.\r\n\r\nD. Dispense the prescription with a steroid cream and advise her to apply it to the affected areas of the skin.\r\n\r\nWhile a steroid cream may help with minor allergic skin reactions, this approach does not address the serious risk of systemic allergic reactions or anaphylaxis.\r\n\r\nPenicillin allergy is a significant consideration in prescribing antibiotics. NICE guidelines recommend that patients with a history of allergy to penicillin or related beta-lactams should be prescribed alternatives to prevent severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. For chest infections, macrolides like clarithromycin or tetracyclines like doxycycline are commonly recommended alternatives. Pharmacists play a vital role in ensuring patient safety by thoroughly assessing allergy history and taking appropriate steps to mitigate risks.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson chapter 5 (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 55-year-old man with type 2 diabetes is prescribed metformin and gliclazide to control his blood glucose levels. He has no history of hypoglycaemia or diabetic complications. His HbA1c level is 75 mmol/mol (9.0%) despite optimal oral therapy. He wants to know if he can use a biphasic regimen to simplify his insulin injections.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nB. When the HbA1c level is between 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) and 75 mmol/mol (9.0%)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- According to NICE guidelines and supported by the BNF, a biphasic insulin regimen (which combines short/rapid-acting insulin with intermediate-acting insulin in one injection) may be considered for people with type 2 diabetes when HbA1c is \u2265 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), but not excessively high (e.g. < 75 mmol/mol), and oral therapy alone (e.g. metformin and gliclazide) is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n- This regimen can be appropriate if the person prefers a simpler insulin regimen or cannot manage basal-bolus therapy (which requires multiple daily injections).\r\n\r\n- In this case, since the patient\u2019s HbA1c is 75 mmol/mol, he falls within the range where a biphasic regimen may be suitable as an initial insulin option.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. HbA1c < 58 mmol/mol (7.5%)\r\n\r\nToo well-controlled to warrant insulin escalation; biphasic insulin is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nC. HbA1c > 75 mmol/mol (9.0%)\r\n\r\nWhile this patient meets this level, most guidelines suggest basal-bolus as a preferred starting regimen if control is severely poor. Biphasic may be less effective in very high HbA1c.\r\n\r\nD. HbA1c > 86 mmol/mol (10.0%)\r\n\r\nSuggests advanced insulin therapy like basal-bolus is needed to bring HbA1c down faster.\r\n\r\nE. HbA1c > 97 mmol/mol (11.0%)\r\n\r\nIndicates urgent intensification, likely needing more intensive insulin support than a biphasic regimen.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiphasic Regimens in Type 2 Diabetes:\r\n\r\n- When to consider: HbA1c \u2265 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) and patient prefers simplicity or can't manage basal-bolus.\r\n\r\n- When NOT to consider: Very high HbA1c (\u226575\u201386 mmol/mol) or if multiple daily adjustments are needed.\r\n\r\n- Formulation: Pre-mixed insulin (e.g. biphasic insulin aspart or biphasic isophane).\r\n\r\n- Pros: Fewer injections, easier to manage.\r\n\r\n- Cons: Less flexibility in dose titration compared to basal-bolus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 6) The Endocrine system:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

As you hand the item out to him you explain the condition and counsel him on the medicine.\u00a0 You tell him not to \u2018pop the pills out of their original packaging\u2019 or put them in to any other types of pill containers.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) There is a chamber in the pack which contains a substance that will prevent the tablets absorbing water, so that they don\u2019t break apart\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nNicorandil tablets are hygroscopic, meaning they readily absorb moisture from the environment. \r\nThis can lead to the tablets breaking apart or crumbling, reducing the stability, integrity, and effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, they are packaged with a desiccant chamber inside the blister packaging, which absorbs moisture and protects the tablets. \r\nPatients should be advised not to remove tablets from the blister packaging until immediately before use.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Expiry reduced to 7 days\r\n\r\nThere is no specific 7-day limit defined in the SmPC or BNF. The issue is about moisture, not a defined post-blister expiry.\r\n\r\nB) Amber glass container \r\n\r\nThis is used for light-sensitive drugs, but nicorandil is not primarily light-sensitive.\r\n\r\nC) Antimicrobial in the blister \r\n\r\nNo antimicrobial agents are used in nicorandil packaging. The concern is physical degradation, not microbial contamination.\r\n\r\nE) Photolytic agent \r\n\r\nThere is no photolytic protection system in the blister; again, nicorandil is not light-sensitive.\r\n\r\n- Nicorandil is recommended by NICE for the management of stable angina in patients who are intolerant of or inadequately controlled by first-line antianginal therapies (e.g., beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers). \r\n\r\n- It acts as both a potassium-channel activator and nitrate-like vasodilator, reducing myocardial oxygen demand. However, due to its hygroscopic nature, it is particularly susceptible to degradation by environmental moisture. \r\n\r\n- The SmPC for nicorandil explicitly advises that tablets must remain in their original foil blister packs until administration. The protective blister contains a moisture-absorbing chamber, which preserves the tablet\u2019s physical integrity. This counselling point is critical because, once removed from the foil, nicorandil tablets may crumble or lose potency, undermining their therapeutic effect. \r\n\r\n- NICE emphasises that effective medicines use includes ensuring patients understand how to store and handle medicines properly, especially for drugs with known stability concerns.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

After 24 hours of treatment, his trough gentamicin level is 3.5 mg/L.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nE. Stop the gentamicin and switch to another antibiotic\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, particularly in patients with renal impairment like this 65-year-old with CKD stage 3.\r\n\r\n- For once-daily gentamicin dosing, the target trough level should be < 1 mg/L, but certainly < 2 mg/L.\r\n\r\n- A trough level of 3.5 mg/L is significantly elevated, indicating drug accumulation and high risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\n- In such cases, NICE and BNF guidance recommend stopping gentamicin and switching to an alternative antibiotic, especially when renal function is compromised.\r\n\r\n- Consulting a microbiologist or infectious disease specialist is advised to choose the next appropriate agent.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Continue the gentamicin and monitor the trough level daily\r\n\r\nThe trough is already too high and continuing the drug risks worsening nephrotoxicity.\r\n\r\nB. Continue the gentamicin and monitor the trough level every 2\u20133 days\r\n\r\nDelayed monitoring is dangerous when the level is already significantly elevated.\r\n\r\nC. Increase the gentamicin dose to 7 mg/kg once daily\r\n\r\nCompletely inappropriate\u2014would worsen the accumulation and toxicity risk.\r\n\r\nD. Reduce the gentamicin dose to 3 mg/kg once daily\r\n\r\nAlthough dose reduction is logical in renal impairment, continuing treatment with a toxic trough level is not safe. The drug should be stopped first and reassessed.\r\n\r\nE. Stop the gentamicin and switch to another antibiotic\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, this is the most appropriate step in the presence of elevated trough levels and renal impairment.\r\n\r\nGentamicin Monitoring:\r\n\r\n- Trough levels reflect drug clearance and accumulation risk.\r\n\r\nTarget trough for once-daily dosing:\r\n\r\n- < 1 mg/L (some guidance allows up to 2 mg/L).\r\n\r\n- In renal impairment, aminoglycosides must be carefully monitored due to reduced clearance.\r\n\r\n- If trough > 2 mg/L, stop treatment and seek alternative therapy.\r\n\r\n- Monitoring should occur before the second or third dose, especially in those with renal dysfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5, (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer associated with unopposed estrogen exposure\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIn non-hysterectomized women, the addition of progestogen to an oestrogen-based HRT regimen is essential to protect the endometrium. Unopposed oestrogen stimulates the endometrial lining, significantly increasing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and progression to endometrial cancer.

NICE guidelines recommend tailoring HRT to the individual\u2019s needs, balancing benefits and risks while considering factors such as the patient\u2019s history and risk profile.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Manage menopausal symptoms more effectively\r\n\r\nWhile HRT helps alleviate menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flushes, night sweats), the cyclical addition of progestogen is specifically to protect the endometrium, not to enhance symptom control.\r\n\r\nB: Mimic the natural menstrual cycle\r\n\r\nThis regimen mimics some aspects of the menstrual cycle (e.g., progestogen during the luteal phase), but the primary goal is endometrial protection, not reproduction of the natural cycle.\r\n\r\nC: Prevent osteoporosis\r\n\r\nOestrogen in HRT contributes to bone health by reducing bone resorption and preventing osteoporosis, but the addition of progestogen serves a different purpose: endometrial protection.\r\n\r\nE: Reduce the risk of breast cancer\r\n\r\nThe combination of oestrogen and progestogen in HRT may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, particularly with long-term use, so this is not the reason for the addition of progestogen.\r\n\r\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the gold standard for managing menopausal symptoms, such as vasomotor symptoms and urogenital atrophy. According to NICE NG23, women with an intact uterus require progestogen alongside oestrogen to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer caused by unopposed oestrogen. Progestogen is administered in a sequential regimen (10\u201314 days per cycle) for women who are still experiencing menstrual bleeding or a continuous combined regimen for postmenopausal women. The choice of regimen depends on the patient\u2019s symptoms, menstrual status, and individual risk factors.\r\n\r\nRegular review of HRT, typically annually, is recommended to assess its effectiveness and ensure the benefits outweigh the risks, including potential cardiovascular and oncological risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 78-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease and atrial fibrillation is taking warfarin 2.5 mg daily. She has been stable on this regimen for the past year, with an INR of 2.2. She visits her nephrologist for a routine check-up and complains of severe pain and ulceration in her lower legs. She also has a fever and signs of infection. On examination, she has extensive areas of skin necrosis with calcification. A skin biopsy confirms the diagnosis of calciphylaxis.",
    "why": "D: Stop warfarin and start sodium thiosulfate\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCalciphylaxis is a rare and life-threatening condition characterised by vascular calcification, skin necrosis, and thrombosis. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with the use of warfarin, as warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent proteins that prevent vascular calcification. Management involves stopping warfarin and initiating sodium thiosulfate, a treatment that may help reduce vascular calcification and improve healing.\r\n\r\nStopping warfarin is critical to halt further progression of calciphylaxis, as warfarin exacerbates vascular calcification by inhibiting matrix Gla-protein, a vitamin K-dependent inhibitor of calcification. Sodium thiosulfate acts as a chelating agent, helping to dissolve calcium deposits and improve wound healing. It is used as part of the management of calciphylaxis, often in conjunction with wound care, infection management, and dialysis adjustments.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Continue warfarin\r\n\r\nContinuing warfarin is inappropriate as it exacerbates vascular calcification and worsens calciphylaxis.\r\n\r\nB: Stop warfarin and start heparin\r\n\r\nWhile stopping warfarin is correct, heparin does not address the underlying calcification in calciphylaxis. It might be used temporarily to manage thrombotic risk, but it does not treat the calciphylaxis itself.\r\n\r\nC: Stop warfarin and start rivaroxaban\r\n\r\nRivaroxaban is an anticoagulant, but it does not target the underlying pathophysiology of calciphylaxis and does not prevent vascular calcification.\r\n\r\nE: Stop warfarin and start apixaban\r\n\r\nSimilar to rivaroxaban, apixaban is an alternative anticoagulant but does not address the calcification or necrosis associated with calciphylaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

This target balances the benefits of lowering blood pressure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events while minimising the potential adverse effects associated with overtreatment in older adults.\r\n\r\nAdditional Guidance:\r\n\r\nHome or Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM): The equivalent target for home or ABPM is < 145/85 mmHg.\r\nTreatment should be tailored to the individual, considering overall health, comorbidities, and frailty.\r\n\r\nManagement Recommendations:\r\n\r\nLifestyle Advice: Encourage regular physical activity, a balanced diet, smoking cessation, and reduced salt intake.\r\nMedication: Ensure antihypertensive therapy is optimised and well-tolerated. Common first-line options include:\r\nCalcium-channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine).\r\nACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly if there are additional indications like diabetes or chronic kidney disease.\r\nThiazide-like diuretics (e.g., indapamide).\r\n\r\nMonitoring: Regularly review blood pressure and assess for side effects or complications of treatment.\r\n\r\nFor patients aged 80 years or older with hypertension, the clinic blood pressure target is < 150/90 mmHg to optimise cardiovascular outcomes while reducing treatment-related risks.

    "text": "A 26-year-old man with schizophrenia visits the pharmacy for a repeat prescription and tells you that he has been experiencing sexual dysfunction, such as reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory failure. He says that he is very distressed by this and wants to switch to another antipsychotic medication that has less impact on his sexual function.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Aripiprazole\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAripiprazole is a partial dopamine D2 receptor agonist and an atypical antipsychotic. Unlike other antipsychotics, it does not significantly increase prolactin levels, which are a major cause of sexual dysfunction in patients on antipsychotics. In fact, aripiprazole has been shown in studies to improve sexual function, especially when switching from prolactin raising agents like risperidone or haloperidol.\r\n\r\nSexual side effects (low libido, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia) are particularly common with antipsychotics that raise prolactin, and these effects can severely impact adherence, mental health, and quality of life.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Clozapine\r\nAlthough prolactin levels are usually lower with clozapine than with haloperidol or risperidone, sexual dysfunction is still common, possibly due to anticholinergic and sedative effects. Clozapine also has a complex side effect profile and requires frequent blood monitoring.\r\n\r\nC) Haloperidol\r\nA typical antipsychotic with strong dopamine blockade, it significantly increases prolactin, often causing sexual dysfunction, gynecomastia, and menstrual irregularities. Very likely to be problematic in younger men.\r\n\r\nD) Quetiapine\r\nHas a moderate risk of sexual dysfunction and less prolactin elevation than haloperidol or risperidone, but still carries a higher risk compared to aripiprazole.\r\n\r\nE) Risperidone\r\nHas one of the highest rates of sexual dysfunction among antipsychotics due to marked prolactin elevation. Commonly causes decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory difficulties.\r\n\r\nClinical Summary:\r\n\r\nSexual dysfunction is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics and is often under reported by patients.\r\n\r\nDrugs that raise prolactin (e.g. risperidone, haloperidol) are most likely to cause these effects.\r\n\r\nAripiprazole is the preferred choice for patients concerned about sexual side effects, and may even reduce prolactin.\r\n\r\nNICE and BNF support individualising antipsychotic treatment based on side effect profiles, patient preference, and adherence factors.",

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE) Switch to sertraline before pregnancy\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor women planning pregnancy, the choice of antidepressant should balance maternal mental health stability with fetal safety. According to NICE guidelines, SSRIs are commonly used in pregnancy if clinically indicated, but sertraline is considered the preferred SSRI due to its favourable safety profile in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nSertraline has the lowest risk of congenital malformations and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), and least placental transfer among SSRIs.\r\n\r\nFluoxetine, while often continued in patients already well stabilised on it, has a longer half-life, and some evidence of increased risk of congenital heart defects and neonatal withdrawal symptoms, especially if used in late pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is stable but open to switching, switching to sertraline pre-conception is advisable for optimal safety.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Continue fluoxetine throughout pregnancy\r\n\r\n\u2192 Not preferred. While fluoxetine can be continued in women with a strong relapse risk, it is not first-line due to its long half-life and higher risk of neonatal complications compared to sertraline.\r\n\r\nB) Stop fluoxetine before pregnancy\r\n\r\n\u2192 Not appropriate. Abrupt discontinuation of antidepressants can lead to relapse, which poses risks to both mother and baby. Stopping without switching or tapering is not recommended.\r\n\r\nC) Stop fluoxetine during the third trimester\r\n\r\n\u2192 Not recommended. This increases the risk of maternal relapse at a crucial time. If a decision is made to change or stop, it should be planned pre-conception or early in pregnancy, with appropriate psychiatric input.\r\n\r\nD) Switch to escitalopram before pregnancy\r\n\r\n\u2192 Not first-line. Although escitalopram is sometimes used in pregnancy, sertraline has a more established safety profile, particularly for use in the perinatal period.",

Also, bloody diarrhoea is less common in typical foodborne illnesses.\r\n\r\nD) Gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nUnlikely in a young woman with no risk factors and on clindamycin. Symptoms are more consistent with infective diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a classic presentation of pseudomembranous colitis due to C. difficile, most likely caused by clindamycin.

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE) Sildenafil and nitrates interaction\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- This patient is experiencing severe hypotension (BP 90/60 mmHg), headache, dizziness, and flushing, which are hallmark signs of excessive vasodilation.\r\n\r\n- Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor that increases cyclic GMP levels, promoting smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.\r\n\r\n- Isosorbide mononitrate is a nitrate that also increases nitric oxide, leading to further cyclic GMP activation and vasodilation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, the concurrent use of nitrates and PDE5 inhibitors is contraindicated, because the synergistic vasodilatory effect can cause profound, potentially fatal hypotension.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Angina-induced hypotension\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 angina itself does not directly lower blood pressure. The hypotension here is medication-induced.\r\n\r\nB) Nitrates-induced hypotension\r\n\r\nPartially correct, but not the full picture. Nitrates alone can lower BP, but the severe hypotension here is due to the dangerous interaction with sildenafil, not nitrates alone.\r\n\r\nC) Pulmonary hypertension-induced hypotension\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 while pulmonary hypertension affects the lungs\u2019 vasculature, it doesn't typically cause systemic hypotension.\r\n\r\nD) Sildenafil-induced hypotension\r\n\r\nAgain, partially correct. Sildenafil can lower blood pressure, but when used alone at this dose for pulmonary hypertension, it's usually safe. The interaction with nitrates is the key issue here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe combination of sildenafil and isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension.

Lisinopril\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE hypertension guidelines, patients under the age of 55 who are of white European origin, with no diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease, should be offered an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker as first line pharmacological treatment. Lisinopril is a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor that lowers blood pressure by blocking the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, reducing vasoconstriction and water retention. This patient's QRISK3 score is above 10 percent, which supports starting antihypertensive treatment in addition to lifestyle modification.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Amlodipine\r\n\r\nThis would be first line in patients aged 55 or older, or in younger patients of Black African or Caribbean descent. This patient is under 55 and white, so an ACE inhibitor is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nB. Bisoprolol\r\n\r\nBeta-blockers are not used as first-line agents for primary hypertension unless there is another indication such as angina, post-myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation. They are usually considered at a later stage in treatment.\r\n\r\nC. Bendroflumethiazide\r\n\r\nThiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are preferred over bendroflumethiazide for blood pressure management. However, they are not used first-line in this patient group unless ACE inhibitors are not tolerated.\r\n\r\nE. No drug treatment\r\n\r\nAlthough the patient is willing to make lifestyle changes, his blood pressure is in the stage 2 range (clinic BP \u2265160/100 mmHg) and his QRISK3 is over 10 percent. NICE recommends initiating drug treatment in this scenario to reduce long-term cardiovascular risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor patients under 55 with stage 2 hypertension and a QRISK3 score over 10 percent, drug treatment should be started alongside lifestyle changes. ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril are recommended first-line unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Ethnicity, age, and comorbidities guide the choice of antihypertensive agent.

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE) Flucloxacillin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFlucloxacillin is known to cause cholestatic jaundice (a form of liver injury) as a rare but serious adverse effect, especially in older adults and those who receive prolonged treatment. This hepatotoxicity typically presents after the course has ended, and jaundice may develop days to weeks after stopping the antibiotic.\r\n\r\nThe MHRA and BNF highlight that:\r\n\r\n- Risk increases in patients over 55\r\n\r\n- It is often idiosyncratic, not dose-dependent\r\n\r\n- It may present with pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice\r\n\r\n- Therefore, in a patient with recent use of an antibiotic for cellulitis and new-onset jaundice, flucloxacillin is the most likely culprit.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Amoxicillin\r\n\r\nCan cause rash, particularly in viral infections, and rarely liver injury\u2014but not typically cholestatic jaundice. More commonly associated with hepatocellular injury when combined with clavulanic acid (i.e., in co-amoxiclav).\r\n\r\nB) Ciprofloxacin\r\n\r\nRarely associated with hepatitis or transaminase elevation, but jaundice is not a hallmark toxicity.

    "text": "A 50-year-old woman with stress incontinence is taking duloxetine and aspirin.",
    "why": "Increased risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can increase the risk of bleeding by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Similarly, aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), reducing the formation of thromboxane A2 and impairing platelet aggregation. When used together, these two medications can have an additive effect on reducing platelet function, significantly increasing the risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nPatients on this combination should be monitored for signs of bleeding, such as easy bruising, nosebleeds, gastrointestinal bleeding, or prolonged bleeding from cuts. Counselling on recognising these symptoms and avoiding unnecessary trauma is also essential.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Decreased absorption of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect as neither duloxetine nor aspirin affects the absorption of antimuscarinics, and this interaction is unrelated to the medications in this scenario.\r\n\r\nB: Decreased efficacy of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because neither duloxetine nor aspirin reduces the efficacy of antimuscarinics.\r\n\r\nC: Increased antimuscarinic side effects\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because duloxetine and aspirin do not have antimuscarinic properties and do not increase such side effects.\r\n\r\nE: Increased levels of duloxetine\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because aspirin does not inhibit the metabolism of duloxetine. Duloxetine is metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and aspirin does not interact with these pathways.\r\n\r\nDuloxetine, an SNRI, is commonly used for stress urinary incontinence and other conditions, such as depression and chronic pain. According to the BNF, SNRIs, including duloxetine, are associated with an increased risk of bleeding, particularly in patients using concomitant medications that impair platelet function, such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\r\n\r\nThe additive effect of these medications on platelet aggregation inhibition can lead to increased bleeding risk. This is particularly concerning in older adults, who may also be at higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. NICE guidelines recommend monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering gastroprotection (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) in high-risk patients.\r\n\r\nPatients should be advised to watch for warning signs of bleeding and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms such as dark stools, haematuria, or prolonged bleeding occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nD. 3.0\u20134.0\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPatients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are at increased risk of thrombotic events, both venous and arterial. NICE guidance (NG158) recommends an INR of 2.0\u20133.0 for patients with APS and venous thromboembolism (such as DVT or PE). However, in patients with APS who have had an arterial thrombotic event such as ischaemic stroke, NICE does not specify an INR target.\r\n\r\nIn this context, national practice follows British Society for Haematology and BNF guidance, which recommend a higher intensity INR range of 3.0\u20134.0 to prevent recurrent arterial events in APS. This patient has already had a stroke, so a more intensive level of anticoagulation is appropriate.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. 2.0\u20133.0\r\n\r\nThis INR range is appropriate for APS with venous thromboembolism, but it is not sufficient in patients who have had an arterial thrombotic event such as stroke.\r\n\r\nB. 2.0\u20132.5\r\n\r\nThis range is subtherapeutic and not recommended in any form of APS. It would not provide adequate stroke prevention.\r\n\r\nC. 2.5\u20133.5\r\n\r\nWhile closer to the target, this range does not meet the recommended intensity of anticoagulation for arterial thrombosis in APS. The upper limit should be closer to 4.0.\r\n\r\nE to H (ranges above 3.5)\r\n\r\nThese ranges exceed the safe upper limit for most patients and are not recommended due to increased risk of bleeding. INR values above 4.0 are not supported by evidence for improved outcomes in APS and may cause harm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, the INR target range depends on the type of thrombotic event. For venous events, NICE recommends 2.0\u20133.0. For arterial events, such as stroke, national guidance from BSH and BNF supports an INR target of 3.0\u20134.0. NICE does not contradict this; it simply does not specify a figure for arterial APS, so specialist guidance is followed.",

    "why": "G. Pregnancy and lactation\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is an antimetabolite and immunosuppressant used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, it is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its high risk of teratogenicity (causing severe and potentially fatal fetal abnormalities).\r\n\r\nMethotrexate should also be avoided by women planning to conceive, as it interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and replication, which can harm the fetus. Women who are planning a pregnancy must stop methotrexate at least six months before conception to ensure complete elimination of the drug.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nThis is not a contraindication for methotrexate, although patients with severe pulmonary issues may require caution due to the potential for methotrexate-induced pneumonitis.\r\n\r\nB. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease\r\n\r\nMethotrexate does not have a direct contraindication for cardiovascular disease but should be used cautiously in patients at risk of complications.\r\n\r\nC. Concomitant use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is not directly contraindicated with anticoagulants, but concurrent use can increase the risk of bleeding due to gastrointestinal toxicity.\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is not contraindicated in diabetes. However, care should be taken to monitor renal function, as methotrexate is excreted renally and impaired function can lead to toxicity.\r\n\r\nE. History of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nMethotrexate can cause gastrointestinal toxicity (e.g., mucositis, ulcers) but is not outright contraindicated unless there is a history of severe GI bleeding.\r\n\r\nF. Liver disease or alcoholism\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or alcoholism due to its hepatotoxic effects, but this is not the concern in this scenario.\r\n\r\nH. Severe renal impairment\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is contraindicated in severe renal impairment because it is primarily excreted via the kidneys. Renal impairment increases the risk of toxicity, but the patient in this case does not have this condition.\r\n\r\nThe NICE guidelines emphasise that methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy and during breastfeeding due to its teratogenic effects. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for at least six months after discontinuation of methotrexate. Similarly, men taking methotrexate who plan to conceive should also discontinue the drug at least six months beforehand.\r\n\r\nPatients should receive counselling on risks before initiating methotrexate therapy, particularly regarding reproductive health and planning for pregnancy.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Dulaglutide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDulaglutide is the most appropriate GLP-1 receptor agonist for this patient with severe renal impairment (eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2). According to the BNF and NICE guidelines, certain GLP-1 receptor agonists should be avoided or used with caution in patients with renal impairment, as they are renally excreted and may accumulate, increasing the risk of adverse effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances and dehydration.\r\n\r\nAmong GLP-1 receptor agonists:\r\n\r\nDulaglutide does not have specific contraindications in severe renal impairment and can be used safely.\r\nOther options, such as exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide, should either be avoided or used with caution in patients with significantly reduced eGFR.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Exenatide\r\n\r\nContraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, as exenatide is renally excreted and may accumulate, leading to increased gastrointestinal side effects.\r\n\r\nC: Liraglutide\r\n\r\nShould be avoided if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, due to limited safety data in severe renal impairment.\r\n\r\nD: Lixisenatide\r\n\r\nShould be used with caution in eGFR 30\u201350 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2 and is not recommended below 30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2.\r\n\r\nE: Semaglutide\r\n\r\nCan be used in renal impairment, but caution is advised in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2, as there is limited safety data in this population.\r\n\r\nGLP-1 receptor agonists are widely used for managing type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients who require weight reduction and improved glycaemic control. According to NICE NG28, their use in patients with renal impairment requires careful selection due to varying levels of renal excretion. Dulaglutide is a preferred option for patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m\u00b2 as it does not require renal dose adjustments, whereas exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide should be avoided or used with caution. Additionally, regular renal function monitoring is essential in patients with diabetes, as chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of drug accumulation and adverse effects.\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "G) Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe misuse of prescription medication, such as snorting crushed oxycodone tablets for recreational purposes, qualifies as suspected abuse or misuse. According to the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and NICE guidelines, any misuse of medicines should be reported via the Yellow Card Scheme. The Yellow Card Scheme aims to monitor and report concerns over drug misuse, abuse, and other safety issues. This report would help authorities understand the extent of the problem, assess risks, and implement appropriate measures for public health and safety.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction \u2013 This option would be suitable if the reaction was a known side effect of the drug, but abuse and misuse require reporting under a separate category.\r\n\r\nB) Report: Black triangle medicine \u2013 Black triangle medicines are closely monitored for safety issues, but misuse of a drug does not necessarily correlate with the Black Triangle status unless a new risk emerges.\r\n\r\nC) Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction \u2013 This option applies to reactions that occur after prolonged exposure, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nD) Report: Herbal or Homoeopathic medicine \u2013 This is irrelevant, as oxycodone is not a herbal or homeopathic medicine.\r\n\r\nE) Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction \u2013 While opioid overdose can be life-threatening, the symptoms described (dependence and withdrawal) do not fit this category of adverse reactions.\r\n\r\nF) Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine \u2013 This does not apply here since the tablets are described as being from a legitimate prescription.\r\n\r\nH) Report: Vaccine reaction \u2013 This is also irrelevant, as the case does not involve a vaccine.\r\n\r\nThe correct response to this scenario is to report the suspected abuse or misuse of oxycodone under the Yellow Card Scheme. Misuse of prescription medication, particularly when obtained illicitly or used inappropriately, poses significant public health risks and must be monitored. The MHRA encourages the reporting of such cases to ensure patient safety, facilitate risk assessments, and prevent further misuse. By reporting misuse, healthcare professionals contribute to a broader effort to combat prescription drug abuse and support better pharmacovigilance.\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can visit the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 - 16 (MHRA) :\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She takes the following medicines:\r\nlorazepam 2mg tablets, one tablet daily\r\nescitalopram 10mg tablets, one tablet daily\r\nglipizide 5mg tablets, one tablet twice a day\r\nlevothyroxine sodium 100microgram tablets, one tablet every morning\r\nnaproxen 500mg tablets, one to two tablets every six hours when required\r\nquetiapine 25mg tablets, one tablet twice a day\r\nlinagliptin 5mg/metformin 500mg tablets, one tablet twice daily\r\nramipril 5mg tablets, one tablet daily\r\nzopiclone 7.5mg tablets, one tablet at night when required\r\nThe woman has questions about her medicines, particularly about side effects.",
    "why": "D. Naproxen\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nNaproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can impair renal function by reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins help maintain renal blood flow, particularly in patients with underlying renal or systemic disease. Naproxen\u2019s afferent arteriole vasoconstriction can lead to a reduction in glomerular filtration pressure.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the patient is also taking Ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors cause efferent arteriole dilation, which can further reduce glomerular pressure. The combination of NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors creates a \"triple whammy\" effect, significantly increasing the risk of AKI.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\nNSAIDs (e.g., Naproxen): Cause afferent arteriole vasoconstriction, reducing renal perfusion.\r\nACE inhibitors (e.g., Ramipril): Cause efferent arteriole dilation, lowering filtration pressure.\r\nTogether, these effects reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR), risking AKI.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Escitalopram: Rarely associated with AKI, though electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hyponatraemia) can occur.\r\n\r\nB. Levothyroxine: Unlikely to cause AKI but can contribute to systemic changes if dosed improperly.\r\n\r\nC. Lorazepam: Sedative with no significant renal effects.\r\n\r\nE. Quetiapine: Unlikely to cause AKI directly but may contribute indirectly via metabolic syndrome or dehydration.\r\n\r\nIn patients with polypharmacy, identifying nephrotoxic drugs is crucial to minimise the risk of AKI. Naproxen is the most likely culprit in this case due to its NSAID mechanism and its interaction with Ramipril, which exacerbates the risk by altering glomerular pressure dynamics. Regular monitoring of renal function and medication adjustments are key to preventing such complications.\r\n\r\nThis aligns with NICE guidelines, which recommend avoiding nephrotoxic drugs like NSAIDs in patients at risk of AKI, particularly when combined with ACE inhibitors or diuretics.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 7 (Genitourinary):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 55-year-old woman comes to the pharmacy with a swollen, painful, and reddish left leg. She says she has been feeling short of breath and chest pain for the last few days. She has been taking oral HRT (estradiol and norethisterone) for the past two years to manage her menopausal symptoms. She has no other medical conditions or allergies.",
    "why": "A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg that has caused a pulmonary embolism (PE) in her lungs.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms of a swollen, painful, and reddish left leg along with shortness of breath and chest pain are classic signs of venous thromboembolism (VTE), specifically deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with progression to pulmonary embolism (PE).\r\n\r\nOral hormone replacement therapy (HRT), particularly formulations containing estradiol and norethisterone, increases the risk of VTE by promoting a pro-thrombotic state. This risk is higher with oral HRT compared to transdermal HRT and is more pronounced with synthetic progestogens, like norethisterone.\r\n\r\nAction Steps:\r\n\r\nThe patient should be advised to seek urgent medical attention as VTE is a potentially life-threatening condition. HRT should be discontinued immediately, and a definitive diagnosis of DVT/PE should be confirmed through imaging (e.g., Doppler ultrasound for DVT and CT pulmonary angiography for PE). Anticoagulation therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for VTE.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: A cellulitis infection in her left leg that has spread to her lungs.\r\n\r\nCellulitis typically presents with localised redness, warmth, and swelling, often accompanied by fever. It does not cause chest pain or shortness of breath, and there is no mechanism for it to spread to the lungs.\r\n\r\nC: A lymphedema in her left leg that has caused fluid accumulation in her lungs.\r\n\r\nLymphedema causes chronic swelling due to impaired lymphatic drainage but is painless and not associated with chest symptoms. It is unrelated to pulmonary complications.\r\n\r\nD: A peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in her left leg that has reduced the blood flow to her lungs.\r\n\r\nPAD typically causes leg pain on exertion (claudication) and is not associated with swelling, redness, or pulmonary symptoms. It does not cause reduced blood flow to the lungs.\r\n\r\nE: A varicose vein in her left leg that has ruptured and caused bleeding in her lungs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins cause localised swelling and discomfort but do not lead to pulmonary complications or chest pain. Rupture would cause localised bleeding, not bleeding in the lungs.\r\n\r\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing DVT and PE, is a serious and potentially fatal condition. According to NICE, risk factors for VTE include oral hormone replacement therapy (HRT), obesity, immobility, recent surgery, and a personal or family history of thrombosis. The risk of VTE is higher with oral HRT than with transdermal formulations due to their systemic effects on clotting factors. Symptoms of DVT include unilateral leg swelling, redness, and pain, while PE presents with chest pain, dyspnoea, and hypoxia. Patients on HRT who develop symptoms of VTE should stop the medication immediately and seek urgent medical attention for diagnosis and treatment, which typically involves anticoagulation.\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "Insulin requirements in people with diabetes can vary depending on many factors, such as blood glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, physical activity, and other medications. However, some factors may not have a significant effect on insulin needs and can be ignored when adjusting insulin doses.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nA. Blood pressure\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWhile blood pressure is an important parameter to monitor in people with diabetes (due to the increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications), it does not directly impact insulin requirements or how insulin is absorbed or metabolised. Therefore, blood pressure is not a factor used when adjusting insulin doses.\r\n\r\nNICE advises managing blood pressure in diabetes for long-term health outcomes, but adjusting insulin is not required solely based on blood pressure readings.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB. Coeliac disease\r\n\r\nThis autoimmune condition affects nutrient absorption, particularly carbohydrates, and can cause unpredictable changes in blood glucose. Once gluten-free diet is initiated, insulin needs often increase due to improved absorption.\r\n\r\nC. Injection site\r\n\r\nDifferent areas (e.g., abdomen vs. thigh) absorb insulin at different rates. For example, the abdomen offers faster absorption than the thigh. Rotation of injection sites is essential to avoid lipohypertrophy, which can alter insulin absorption unpredictably.\r\n\r\nD. Injection technique\r\n\r\nPoor technique (e.g., not injecting into subcutaneous tissue or reusing needles) can alter insulin absorption, leading to hypo- or hyperglycaemia.\r\n\r\nE. Psychological issues\r\n\r\nStress and psychological conditions can cause hormonal changes (e.g., increased cortisol), which can increase insulin resistance and raise insulin requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors Affecting Insulin Requirements\r\n\r\nDo affect insulin needs:\r\n\r\n- Carbohydrate intake\r\n\r\n- Injection site & technique\r\n\r\n- Physical activity\r\n\r\n- Illness/infection\r\n\r\n- Stress and psychological factors\r\n\r\n- Hormonal conditions\r\n\r\n- Coeliac disease (especially when treated)\r\n\r\nDo not directly affect insulin needs:\r\n\r\n- Blood pressure (though important to control for long-term health)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 6) The Endocrine system:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You get from a prescriber who wants your advice on a suitable anti-emetic for a 22-year-old woman undergoing chemotherapy. The prescriber would like to initiate metoclopramide as the patient has failed to respond adequately to several other anti-emetics.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nA. Should not be used for longer than 5 days\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMetoclopramide is associated with a high risk of extrapyramidal side effects, particularly tardive dyskinesia, which can be irreversible. \r\nTo minimise this risk, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and NICE guidelines recommend:\r\n\r\n-  Short-term use only (maximum 5 days).\r\n-  Restricted indications, including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), but only if other anti-emetics are ineffective.\r\n-  Avoiding long-term use due to the risk of movement disorders.\r\n\r\nChemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) management:\r\n\r\n- First-line options: 5HT\u2083 receptor antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone), and neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists (e.g., aprepitant).\r\n\r\n- Metoclopramide may be considered as a second-line or adjunct treatment if first-line options fail.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Cannot be used in adults under 30 years of age\r\n\r\nWhile younger adults and children are at a higher risk of extrapyramidal effects, metoclopramide can still be used in adults aged 22 years, provided treatment duration is limited.\r\n\r\nC. Should be used continuously on a regular basis\r\n\r\n Metoclopramide should not be used continuously due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia. It should only be used short-term (maximum 5 days).\r\n\r\nD. The dose must be administered every 3 hours\r\n\r\nThe usual dosing regimen for metoclopramide in adults is 10 mg up to three times daily (every 8 hours). More frequent dosing increases the risk of adverse effects.\r\n\r\nE. The maximum daily dose is 50 milligrams\r\n\r\nThe maximum daily dose in adults is 30 mg (10 mg three times daily). Higher doses increase the risk of extrapyramidal side effects.\r\n\r\nClinical Guidance on Metoclopramide Use (NICE 2025)\r\n\r\n- Indications in Adults:\r\n\r\nCINV (second-line)\r\n\r\nPost-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\r\n\r\nMigraine-associated nausea (to enhance oral analgesic absorption)\r\n\r\n- Key Safety Considerations:\r\n\r\nShort-term use (max 5 days).\r\n\r\nMaximum dose: 10 mg up to three times daily (30 mg/day max).\r\n\r\nAvoid prolonged use due to the risk of tardive dyskinesia.\r\n\r\nCaution in young adults (higher risk of dystonic reactions).\r\n\r\nContraindicated in children <1 year.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Feeling shaky or sweaty, with cold, clammy skin, feeling dizzy and weak, being pale, having a sudden feeling of excess hunger, increased heart rate, blurred vision, confusion, irritable or nervous\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the NICE guidelines and BNF, hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 4.0 mmol/L) is a medical emergency in people with diabetes and must be treated promptly. The symptoms are typically rapid in onset and can be autonomic (adrenergic) or neuroglycopenic:\r\n\r\n- Autonomic symptoms: Shakiness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, hunger, pallor\r\n\r\n- Neuroglycopenic symptoms: Confusion, visual disturbance, dizziness, irritability, fatigue\r\n\r\nIf left untreated, it can progress to seizures or unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Describes hyperglycaemia, not hypoglycaemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, blurred vision).\r\n\r\nC. Features (e.g., fruity breath, nausea, abdominal pain, rapid breathing) suggest diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), not hypoglycaemia.\r\n\r\nD. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia symptoms may include nightmares and morning confusion, but this is incomplete and less appropriate than option B, which reflects classic daytime symptoms.\r\n\r\nE. Describes infection or allergic reactions, not related to blood glucose levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypoglycaemia in Diabetes:\r\n\r\n- Definition: Blood glucose < 4 mmol/L\r\n\r\n- Causes: Missed meals, excessive insulin/sulfonylurea, unplanned activity\r\n\r\n- Early symptoms: Sweating, shaking, hunger, tachycardia, dizziness\r\n\r\n- Late symptoms: Confusion, blurred vision, irritability, loss of consciousness\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\n\r\n- Mild: 15\u201320g of fast-acting carbohydrate (e.g., glucose tablets)\r\n\r\n- Severe: IM glucagon or IV glucose\r\n\r\n- Prevention: Patient education, regular monitoring, tailored insulin adjustment\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 6) The Endocrine system:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has no other medical conditions or allergies. He visits his community pharmacist for a medication review and reports feeling breathless, tired and dizzy. He also has swollen ankles and a slow pulse.",
    "why": "B: He is experiencing an adverse drug interaction between diltiazem and bisoprolol.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe symptoms described: breathlessness, swollen ankles, dizziness, fatigue, and slow pulse, are consistent with bradycardia and reduced cardiac output. This is a direct result of the interaction between diltiazem and bisoprolol, which together excessively slow the heart rate and weaken its contractions. This interaction is contraindicated in the BNF due to its potential to cause severe adverse effects.\r\n\r\nThe patient should be advised to stop both medications immediately and referred to their doctor for an alternative treatment plan.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: He is experiencing an adverse drug reaction to diltiazem:\r\nWhile diltiazem can cause side effects like hypotension or bradycardia, the combination with bisoprolol is the more likely cause of this patient's severe symptoms.\r\n\r\nC: He is experiencing an exacerbation of his angina:\r\nThe symptoms do not align with an angina exacerbation, which typically involves chest pain rather than systemic symptoms like dizziness or swelling.\r\n\r\nD: He is experiencing an exacerbation of his hypertension:\r\nHypertension exacerbation would not cause a slow pulse. Instead, this patient exhibits signs of hypotension (e.g., dizziness and fatigue).\r\n\r\nE: He is experiencing a normal response to his medication:\r\nThese symptoms are not normal. They indicate a serious adverse interaction requiring urgent medical intervention.\r\n\r\nDiltiazem and Bisoprolol Interaction\r\n\r\nDiltiazem is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that slows heart rate and reduces cardiac workload.\r\nBisoprolol is a beta-blocker that also reduces heart rate and cardiac contractility.\r\nTogether, they cause excessive slowing of the heart, leading to bradycardia, hypotension, and potentially heart failure.\r\nCombination therapy with these two drugs is contraindicated in the BNF.\r\nPatients on either medication should be closely monitored, and alternative options should be sought if both are needed.\r\nThis case underscores the importance of careful medication reviews and awareness of potential drug interactions in managing cardiovascular conditions. Always check for contraindications and refer to clinical guidelines, such as the BNF, when in doubt.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia, for which he takes amlodipine 10 mg once daily and atorvastatin 20 mg once daily. He also takes aspirin 75 mg once daily for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for diclofenac has been provided for you:\r\n[SmPC for diclofenac](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/4333/smpc)",
    "text": "**Theme: Contraindications**\r\n\r\n**For each of the following scenarios, select the best option from the list above. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**",
    "why": "E. History of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDiclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is contraindicated in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to its potential to cause GI adverse effects. These include ulceration, perforation, or bleeding, especially when combined with aspirin, which increases the risk of GI complications through additive effects on the gastric mucosa. In this scenario, the patient is on aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention, further elevating the risk of serious GI complications.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nNSAIDs can exacerbate asthma in some patients (e.g., those with NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease), but this is not relevant to this scenario as no respiratory condition is mentioned.\r\n\r\nB. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease\r\n\r\nDiclofenac is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and should be used cautiously in patients with established cardiovascular disease. However, in this case, the primary concern is the GI risk due to concomitant aspirin use and the history of PUD.\r\n\r\nC. Concomitant use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets\r\n\r\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent, and its use with NSAIDs like diclofenac increases bleeding risk. While this is a concern, the specific contraindication here is the history of GI bleeding rather than the use of aspirin alone.\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia\r\n\r\nNo association between diclofenac and diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia contraindicates its use.\r\n\r\nF. Liver disease or alcoholism\r\n\r\nDiclofenac is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment, but this is not applicable here.\r\n\r\nG. Pregnancy and lactation\r\n\r\nNSAIDs are contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy but are not relevant to this scenario involving a male patient.\r\n\r\nH. Severe renal impairment\r\n\r\nNSAIDs, including diclofenac, are contraindicated in severe renal impairment due to their effect on renal perfusion. However, the patient does not have renal impairment in this scenario.\r\n\r\nDiclofenac and Contraindications\r\nDiclofenac, like other NSAIDs, increases the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration, perforation, and bleeding, especially in patients with:\r\n\r\nA history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.\r\nConcomitant use of medications affecting gastric mucosa, such as aspirin, corticosteroids, or anticoagulants.\r\nIn this case, the patient's aspirin use and history of PUD elevate the risk, making diclofenac contraindicated unless the benefits outweigh the risks and the patient is under close supervision, potentially with gastroprotective therapy (e.g., a proton pump inhibitor).\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson chapter 10 ( Musculoskeletal system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 70-year-old patient, who weighs 49 kg, with a history of dementia is currently taking oral rivastigmine. Due to dysphagia, the duty doctor would like the patient to be switched to a transdermal patch.\r\n\r\nThe SmPC has for Rivastigmine has been provided for this question:[SmPC for Rivastigmine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/1185/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "C. Patients taking 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched directly to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nAccording to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for rivastigmine:\r\n\r\nOral to Transdermal Switch: Patients on a total daily oral dose of 3-6 mg/day should be switched to the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch.\r\nTitration: After a minimum of four weeks on the 4.6 mg/24 h patch, and if it is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, which is the recommended effective dose.\r\nHigher Oral Doses: Patients taking 9-12 mg/day orally can be switched directly to the 9.5 mg/24 h patch, but this is not applicable for this scenario.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Patients taking 12 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched directly to 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches: This is incorrect because the 13.3 mg/24 h patch is reserved for patients requiring further dose escalation after stabilisation on the 9.5 mg/24 h patch for at least six months.\r\n\r\nB. Patients taking 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched directly to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches: This dose is not suitable for a direct switch. Patients on 6 mg/day should start with the 4.6 mg/24 h patch first.\r\n\r\nD. Patients taking 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched directly to 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches: This is inappropriate, as the maximum dose is 9.5 mg/24 h for initial switching.\r\n\r\nE. Patients taking 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched directly to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches: Patients on lower oral doses (e.g., 3 mg/day) should start on the 4.6 mg/24 h patch, not the higher dose.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines on the management of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias, rivastigmine is recommended as a treatment option for patients with mild to moderate dementia associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Parkinson\u2019s disease. For patients unable to tolerate oral forms due to issues like dysphagia, the transdermal patch offers an effective alternative, providing consistent drug delivery while minimising gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. When switching from oral to transdermal therapy, dosage equivalence and gradual titration are crucial to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimise adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended to assess tolerability and cognitive response during treatment escalation.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

This reduces the risk of oesophageal irritation, which is a known adverse effect.\r\n\r\nAlthough food may slightly reduce doxycycline absorption, this effect is not clinically significant, and taking it with food improves tolerability, especially for patients prone to nausea or gastric irritation.\r\n\r\nThis makes it the only option on this list that is not required to be taken on an empty stomach, and in practice, is often taken with meals.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Flucloxacillin \r\n\r\nMust be taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after food) as food significantly reduces absorption.\r\n\r\nC) Oxytetracycline \r\n\r\nShould be taken on an empty stomach, ideally 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Food, especially dairy, interferes with absorption.\r\n\r\nD) Phenoxymethylpenicillin \r\n\r\nAlso taken on an empty stomach for optimal absorption. Food reduces its effectiveness.\r\n\r\nE) Tetracycline \r\n\r\nLike oxytetracycline, must be taken on an empty stomach and separately from dairy products, iron, or antacids, as absorption is reduced.\r\n\r\nDoxycycline is the only antibiotic on this list that may be taken with food, and doing so can help reduce GI side effects.\r\nAll other listed antibiotics must be taken on an empty stomach to ensure proper absorption.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5, (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Symptoms include muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and altered mental status, which are not present here.\r\n\r\nD) Serotonin syndrome\r\n\r\nPresents with agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, and fever. While MAOIs can contribute to serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic drugs, that\u2019s not the case here.\r\n\r\nE) Stroke\r\n\r\nWhile hypertensive crisis can lead to stroke, this patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with a hypertensive crisis itself, not a completed cerebrovascular event (e.g. unilateral weakness, facial droop, slurred speech).",

    "why": "B. Lamotrigine \r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nLamotrigine is considered the safest option for women with epilepsy who are planning to become pregnant. It has minimal teratogenic effects compared to other antiepileptic medications and is associated with a lower risk of congenital malformations.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Carbamazepine: \r\n\r\nCarbamazepine is associated with a moderate risk of congenital malformations, including neural tube defects. While it may be an alternative for some women, lamotrigine is preferred due to its lower risk.\r\n\r\nC. Levetiracetam: \r\n\r\nWhile levetiracetam is considered safe during pregnancy, lamotrigine has more established evidence supporting its use in pregnant women with epilepsy, making it the first-line choice.\r\n\r\nD. Phenobarbital: \r\n\r\nPhenobarbital carries a higher risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring and is generally avoided in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nE. Valproate: \r\n\r\nValproate is highly teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy due to the significant risk of congenital malformations, including neural tube defects and developmental delays.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, when treating women with epilepsy who are planning a pregnancy or are pregnant, the choice of antiepileptic medication should minimise the risk to the baby. Valproate and lithium are both contraindicated due to their high teratogenic potential. Lamotrigine is the drug of choice for women with epilepsy as it has a low risk of causing congenital malformations or neurodevelopmental disorders. In cases where other treatments are needed for bipolar disorder, alternative medications with a safer profile during pregnancy should be considered. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are recommended throughout pregnancy to manage both maternal health and the development of the baby.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "F. 500 mg/125 mg twice daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor adults and children weighing \u226540 kg with CrCl between 10\u201330 mL/min, the recommended dose of co-amoxiclav is 500 mg/125 mg twice daily. This ensures effective treatment while accounting for reduced renal clearance, preventing accumulation and toxicity. The dose is appropriate for managing moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in a patient with a CURB-65 score of 2, which signifies the need for robust antibiotic coverage.\r\n\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nA. 250/125 mg once daily: Inadequate dose for moderate to severe symptoms of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nB. 250/125 mg twice daily: Insufficient dose for this severity of infection.\r\n\r\nC. 250/125 mg three times daily: Unnecessary frequency and low dose for pneumonia.\r\n\r\nD. 500 mg/125 mg once daily: Suitable for CrCl <10 mL/min but not sufficient for CrCl of 25.7 mL/min.\r\n\r\nE. 500 mg/125 mg three times daily: Excessive frequency for CrCl of 25.7 mL/min, risking drug toxicity.\r\n\r\nG. 875/125 mg twice daily: Appropriate for patients with normal renal function but too high for those with CrCl of 25.7 mL/min.\r\n\r\nH. 1000/200 mg three times daily: This intravenous dose is excessive and inappropriate for this renal function and infection severity.\r\n\r\nFor community-acquired pneumonia, NICE recommends co-amoxiclav as a first-line treatment in patients requiring hospitalisation or with moderate to severe disease. Dosage adjustments based on renal function are crucial for achieving therapeutic levels without causing toxicity. Monitoring clinical response and renal function throughout treatment ensures optimal outcomes while minimising adverse effects. A CURB-65 score of 2 typically indicates intermediate risk, warranting oral antibiotics like co-amoxiclav with appropriate adjustments for renal impairment.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson chapter 5 (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 15-year-old patient who comes into your community pharmacy with a prescription for co-amoxiclav and a stat dose of dexamethasone. From her PMR, you note that she is a type 1 diabetic currently using a regimen of insulin glargine once daily and Novorapid\u00ae when required. She tells you that she has felt so ill from her cold that she has not been able to eat.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nC) Increase your blood glucose monitoring as well as your insulin dosing\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, patients with type 1 diabetes should never stop insulin, even if they are unwell and not eating. During illness, the body releases stress hormones (e.g., cortisol, adrenaline), which can cause hyperglycaemia and increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Therefore, patients must increase blood glucose monitoring and adjust insulin doses accordingly.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) As you are not eating, you will not require your regular insulin doses\r\n\r\nStopping insulin is dangerous as it can lead to DKA, even if the patient is not eating. Long-acting (basal) insulin should always be continued, and adjustments should be made to rapid-acting insulin based on blood glucose levels.\r\n\r\nB) Do not make any adjustments to your regular blood glucose monitoring \r\n\r\nWhen unwell, blood glucose levels can fluctuate due to stress responses and changes in food intake. More frequent monitoring is required to detect and prevent hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, or ketone build-up.\r\n\r\nD) Inject your insulin intravenously whilst ill as this will give a rapid response \r\n\r\nInsulin should never be self-administered intravenously. IV insulin is only used in hospitals under medical supervision, typically for severe DKA.\r\n\r\nE) Monitor yourself for hypoglycaemia and reduce your regular insulin dosing \r\n\r\nAlthough hypoglycaemia can occur if food intake is significantly reduced, the primary concern during illness is hyperglycaemia and DKA. Adjusting meal-time insulin is sometimes necessary, but basal insulin should not be reduced without monitoring.\r\n\r\nWhen unwell, people with type 1 diabetes should follow sick-day rules to prevent hyperglycaemia, DKA, and dehydration:\r\n\r\n1) Do NOT stop insulin \u2013 Even if not eating, continue long-acting (basal) insulin as prescribed.\r\n\r\n2) Increase blood glucose monitoring \u2013 Check every 2\u20134 hours.\r\n\r\n3) Check ketones \u2013 If blood glucose >11 mmol/L, test for ketones in urine or blood.\r\n\r\n4) Stay hydrated \u2013 Drink at least 3L of fluids per day to prevent dehydration. Use sugary drinks if at risk of hypoglycaemia.\r\n\r\n5)Adjust insulin doses as needed \u2013 Increase rapid-acting insulin if blood glucose is consistently high or ketones are present.\r\n\r\n6) Eat small, frequent meals \u2013 If unable to eat solid food, consume carbohydrate-containing drinks (e.g., milk, soup).\r\n\r\n7) Seek medical help if:\r\n\r\n- Vomiting or unable to keep fluids down\r\n- Blood glucose remains >15 mmol/L despite extra insulin\r\n- Ketones are moderate or high\r\n- Confusion, drowsiness, or breathing difficulties develop\r\n\r\nDiabetes and Illness: Preventing DKA\r\n\r\nIllness can cause significant blood glucose fluctuations, leading to hyperglycaemia, ketosis, or hypoglycaemia. In type 1 diabetes, the main concern is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which occurs when insulin levels are insufficient. NICE guidelines emphasise early detection, frequent monitoring, and insulin dose adjustments to prevent serious complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has no history of eye problems or contact lens use. He has no known allergies and is not taking any regular medication. He is otherwise healthy and has no history of smoking, drinking or drug use.\r\n\r\nYou suspect that he has bacterial conjunctivitis and advise him to wash his eye with warm water and avoid touching or rubbing it.

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Chloramphenicol 0.5% eye drops, one drop every two hours for two days, then every four hours for three days\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- According to NICE and Public Health England (PHE) guidelines, chloramphenicol is the first-line treatment for suspected bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children over 2 years of age, unless contraindicated (e.g. allergy or blood dyscrasia). It is effective against the common bacterial pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.\r\n\r\nThe recommended regimen is:\r\n\r\n- 0.5% eye drops: one drop every 2 hours for 48 hours, then every 4 hours for 5 days, or\r\n\r\n- 1% eye ointment: applied 3\u20134 times daily for 5 days (for those who have difficulty with drops).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Incorrect Options:\r\n\r\nB) Ciprofloxacin 0.3% eye drops \r\n\r\nThis is reserved for corneal ulcers or contact lens wearers due to its broader spectrum and risk of resistance. Not first-line for uncomplicated conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nC) Fusidic acid 1% eye drops \r\n\r\nFusidic acid is second-line, typically used in pregnant women or those who struggle with frequent dosing. It has a narrower spectrum and less activity against Haemophilus influenzae.\r\n\r\nD) Ofloxacin 0.3% eye drops \r\n\r\nAnother fluoroquinolone, like ciprofloxacin. Not recommended as first-line unless there's contact lens use or severe infection.\r\n\r\nE) Prednisolone 1% eye drops \r\n\r\nThis is a corticosteroid, not an antibiotic. It is contraindicated in bacterial conjunctivitis unless prescribed under ophthalmology due to risk of worsening infection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- First-line antibiotic for uncomplicated bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children \u22652 years: Chloramphenicol 0.5% drops or 1% ointment.\r\n\r\n- Use fusidic acid if compliance is difficult or in pregnancy.\r\n\r\n- Avoid corticosteroids unless specialist-initiated.\r\n\r\n- Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) are reserved for more serious eye infections or contact lens users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5, (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He is a non-smoker and has a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2. He has no family history of cardiovascular disease or venous thromboembolism (VTE).\r\n\r\nHe is prescribed sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. He wants to know if he can take these drugs with amiodarone.",
    "why": "E: He should avoid taking sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with amiodarone unless other antiarrhythmic or antiviral drugs are not suitable.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nConcomitant use of amiodarone with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is associated with a risk of severe bradycardia and heart block. According to the BNF, the exact mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood but may involve:\r\n\r\nInhibition of cardiac potassium channels by the antiviral drugs.\r\n\r\nPotentiation of the effects of amiodarone.\r\n\r\nAltered metabolism of amiodarone.\r\n\r\nThe risk is heightened if the patient is also taking beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. Symptoms of bradycardia, such as dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, or fainting, can manifest several hours to days after starting or stopping the antiviral therapy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, co-prescription should be avoided unless no suitable alternatives are available. If use is unavoidable, close monitoring of the patient\u2019s heart rate via ECG and regular check-ups is essential. The patient must also be educated to report any signs of bradycardia immediately.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: He can take sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with amiodarone without any precautions.\r\n\r\nIncorrect. This neglects the significant interaction risk and provides no safeguards for the patient.\r\n\r\nB: He can take sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with amiodarone but he should monitor his heart rate regularly.\r\n\r\nIncorrect. While monitoring heart rate is crucial, simply relying on self-monitoring is insufficient to mitigate the risk of severe bradycardia or heart block.\r\n\r\nC: He can take sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with amiodarone but he should have regular blood tests to check his liver function.\r\n\r\nIncorrect. Liver function monitoring is not directly relevant to managing the risk of bradycardia associated with this drug combination.\r\n\r\nD: He should stop taking amiodarone before starting sofosbuvir and daclatasvir and use an alternative antiarrhythmic drug.\r\n\r\nIncorrect. Discontinuing amiodarone may not be appropriate for a patient with atrial fibrillation, as its replacement requires careful consideration by a cardiologist.\r\n\r\nRisk of Bradycardia with Amiodarone and Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir:\r\n\r\nMechanism: Interaction leads to severe bradycardia or heart block.\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\n\r\nAvoid combination if possible.\r\n\r\nMonitor via ECG if unavoidable.\r\n\r\nEducate patient on recognising symptoms of bradycardia.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: Explore other antiviral or antiarrhythmic options if feasible.\r\n\r\nThis approach prioritises patient safety while addressing therapeutic goals for both atrial fibrillation and chronic hepatitis C infection.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE) Tolcapone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTolcapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, is known to cause severe hepatotoxicity, including fulminant liver failure.

    "text": "A 28-year-old man with epilepsy and HIV infection is starting antiretroviral therapy with efavirenz and tenofovir. He is currently taking carbamazepine, but he is concerned about potential drug interactions.",
    "why": "C. Levetiracetam \r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nLevetiracetam is a preferred choice for managing epilepsy in patients with HIV infection due to its minimal interactions with antiretroviral medications. It does not affect the metabolism of efavirenz or tenofovir, ensuring that these medications maintain their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Carbamazepine: \r\n\r\nCarbamazepine can lower the plasma concentrations of efavirenz and tenofovir, increasing the risk of HIV treatment failure and resistance. Therefore, it is not recommended for patients on these antiretroviral drugs.\r\n\r\nB. Lamotrigine: \r\n\r\nLamotrigine is metabolized by the liver, and efavirenz can reduce its plasma concentration. Although it may be an alternative, careful monitoring and dose adjustments are needed, making it less optimal than levetiracetam.\r\n\r\nD. Phenobarbital: \r\n\r\nPhenobarbital can induce liver enzymes, which may lower the plasma concentrations of efavirenz and tenofovir, reducing the efficacy of HIV treatment. It is typically avoided in patients with HIV infection.\r\n\r\nE. Valproate: \r\n\r\nValproate does not significantly interact with efavirenz or tenofovir, but it may have other risks, such as hepatotoxicity, and may not be as effective for certain types of seizures in patients with HIV.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding significant drug interactions when selecting antiepileptic medications for patients on antiretroviral therapy. Drugs like carbamazepine and phenobarbital can reduce the effectiveness of efavirenz and tenofovir by altering their metabolism, leading to treatment failure. Levetiracetam, with minimal interactions, is recommended as a safer alternative in managing epilepsy in HIV-positive patients. Careful selection of AEDs is essential to ensure both optimal seizure control and effective HIV treatment. Regular monitoring is advised to adjust therapies as needed.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "The European Medicines Agency issued a safety alert for metoclopramide in August 2013,",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nD. Neurological effects\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) safety alert for metoclopramide (August 2013) highlighted the risk of neurological side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as:\r\n\r\n- Acute dystonia (e.g., muscle spasms, oculogyric crisis)\r\n- Tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, particularly with prolonged use)\r\n- Parkinsonism-like symptoms\r\n\r\nTo minimise these risks, the EMA recommended:\r\n\r\n- Restricting metoclopramide use to short-term treatment (maximum 5 days).\r\n- Avoiding long-term use in chronic conditions such as gastroparesis, dyspepsia, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\r\n- Contraindicating use in children under 1 year due to a higher risk of extrapyramidal effects.\r\n- Limiting use in children to second-line treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Cardiac myopathy\r\n\r\nMetoclopramide is not associated with cardiac myopathy. Its primary concern is neurological adverse effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms.\r\n\r\nB.

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE. Use with caution\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe junior doctor is considering adding gliclazide, a sulfonylurea, to a patient already taking metformin for poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes (HbA1c = 79 mmol/mol). While combining metformin with a sulfonylurea like gliclazide is common practice, the correct advice is \u201cuse with caution\u201d due to the increased risk of hypoglycaemia and the patient's current clinical setting.\r\n\r\nKey considerations:\r\n\r\n- The patient has been admitted with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) \u2014 a cardiovascular event that already places metabolic demand and increases the complexity of glycaemic management.\r\n\r\n- Gliclazide increases insulin secretion independent of glucose levels, which makes it effective \u2014 but also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia, especially in:\r\n\r\n- Hospitalised patients\r\n\r\n- Those with irregular oral intake\r\n\r\n- Elderly or renal-impaired individuals\r\n\r\n- BNF and NICE guidelines recommend caution when initiating sulfonylureas in hospitalised or acutely ill patients.\r\n\r\nThe combination of metformin + gliclazide is not contraindicated, but requires careful monitoring of:\r\n\r\n- Renal function\r\n\r\n- Blood glucose levels\r\n\r\n- Food intake\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Avoid:\r\nGliclazide is not contraindicated with metformin, nor in the context of NSTEMI, but requires caution \u2014 so \u201cAvoid\u201d is too strong.\r\n\r\nB. Monitor:\r\nMonitoring is part of care, but not specific enough as a recommendation. \u201cUse with caution\u201d better reflects the risk-benefit consideration.\r\n\r\nC. No interaction:\r\nThere is no direct pharmacokinetic interaction, but the clinical risk of hypoglycaemia makes \u201cNo interaction\u201d an unsafe oversimplification.\r\n\r\nD. Reduce dose:\r\nNo dose reduction is needed automatically at the initiation stage unless renal function is impaired \u2014 this option is misleading.\r\n\r\n\r\nn a patient hospitalised with NSTEMI and poorly controlled diabetes, adding gliclazide to metformin is an accepted practice,but it should be done with caution due to the risk of hypoglycaemia and variable intake during acute illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine Systtem):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nC) Increased risk of seizures\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nOfloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic. When used alongside NSAIDs like naproxen, there is a well-documented interaction that increases the risk of central nervous system stimulation, potentially leading to seizures \u2014 even in patients without a prior history of epilepsy.\r\nAccording to the BNF, \u201cNSAIDs may enhance the risk of convulsions associated with quinolones.\u201d\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) QT interval prolongation\r\n\r\nFluoroquinolones (like ofloxacin) can prolong QT, but naproxen does not contribute to this. It\u2019s not the interaction effect here.\r\n\r\nB) Tendon rupture\r\n\r\nThis is a risk with fluoroquinolones alone (especially in older patients or those on steroids), but naproxen doesn\u2019t increase this risk.\r\n\r\nD) Photosensitivity\r\n\r\nFluoroquinolones can cause this, but it's not interaction-related. Naproxen doesn\u2019t increase this risk.\r\n\r\nE) Hepatotoxicity\r\n\r\nNot a recognised interaction between ofloxacin and naproxen.\r\n\r\nF) Resistance\r\n\r\nNot relevant to this specific interaction.\r\n\r\nG) Hypoglycaemia \r\n\r\nCan be a concern with some antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, especially in diabetic patients, but naproxen doesn\u2019t influence this.\r\n\r\nH) Nephrotoxicity \r\n\r\nNaproxen has nephrotoxic potential, but not a major concern in interaction with ofloxacin directly.\r\n\r\n- When combining fluoroquinolones (e.g. ofloxacin) with NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen), there is an increased risk of seizures, even in patients with no seizure history.\r\nThis is due to additive CNS stimulatory effects. According to the BNF, this interaction should be avoided or monitored carefully.\r\n\r\n- Always check for interactions with fluoroquinolones, as they carry multiple risks including QT prolongation, CNS effects, and tendon rupture.\r\n\r\nPleaase watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A patient has been admitted to hospital with acute psychoses, they were previously stable on clozapine after failure of several other anti-physcotics. It is found that their clozapine levels have fallen to 0.11mg/L, (range: 0.2mg/L \u2013 0.3mg/L). After talking to the patient they tell you that they have been fully adherent to his 100mg twice each day regimen, which is confirmed by their carer (previous result: 0.3m) however they recently became stressed. They broke their arm and have been receiving diclofenac for the pain. It has meant they have been unable to work so have increased their cigarette consumption from 10 to 20 a day.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Increasing smoking can induce hepatic enzymes which will reduce the drug serum level\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nClozapine is primarily metabolised by the CYP1A2 enzyme in the liver. Smoking is a strong inducer of CYP1A2, meaning that it increases the metabolism of drugs broken down by this enzyme, leading to lower plasma levels of clozapine. This patient previously had a therapeutic serum clozapine level (0.3 mg/L) but now has subtherapeutic levels (0.11 mg/L), despite being fully adherent to their prescribed dose of 100 mg twice daily. The most significant recent change in their lifestyle is increasing cigarette consumption from 10 to 20 cigarettes per day, which likely caused CYP1A2 induction, increasing the metabolism of clozapine and reducing its plasma concentration.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the patient\u2019s symptoms of acute psychosis have worsened due to insufficient clozapine levels, and a dose adjustment may be required to restore therapeutic drug levels.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Clozapine induces its own metabolism, so a dose increase is needed over time\r\n\r\nClozapine does not induce its own metabolism. Unlike carbamazepine or rifampicin, clozapine does not have auto-induction properties, making this answer incorrect.\r\n\r\nC) NSAIDs have an interaction with clozapine reducing the absorption of clozapine\r\n\r\nDiclofenac is an NSAID, but it does not reduce the absorption of clozapine. The main concern with NSAIDs in patients on clozapine is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, rather than a significant pharmacokinetic interaction affecting drug levels.\r\n\r\nD) The medicine is no longer effective and so an alternative should be initiated\r\n\r\nClozapine is only used in treatment-resistant schizophrenia when at least two other antipsychotics have failed. If a patient on clozapine experiences worsening symptoms, the cause of the reduced efficacy must be investigated first before considering switching medications. In this case, the issue is enzyme induction from increased smoking, not treatment failure.\r\n\r\nE) Stress can increase the metabolism of clozapine\r\n\r\nStress does not directly increase clozapine metabolism. While stress can affect cortisol levels and mental health, it does not alter CYP1A2 activity in a way that would significantly impact clozapine serum levels.\r\n\r\nClozapine and Smoking:\r\n\r\nClozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used in the treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that small changes in drug levels can significantly impact efficacy and safety. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended to maintain plasma concentrations between 0.2 \u2013 0.6 mg/L, with levels above 1.0 mg/L associated with an increased risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\nCYP1A2 Induction by Smoking:\r\n\r\nTobacco smoke contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which induce CYP1A2 activity.\r\nSmoking increases the metabolism of clozapine, lowering plasma concentrations and reducing its effectiveness.\r\nHeavy smokers (>10 cigarettes/day) may require higher doses of clozapine than non-smokers to maintain therapeutic levels.\r\nIf a patient stops smoking, clozapine metabolism slows down, leading to increased plasma levels and a risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB) Electrical cardioversion\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThis patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with haemodynamic instability \u2014 as evidenced by a very high pulse (180 bpm) and hypertensive emergency (BP 210/120 mmHg) along with ST segment depression (suggestive of myocardial strain or ischaemia). NICE and Resuscitation Council UK guidelines recommend immediate electrical cardioversion in haemodynamically unstable AF.\r\n\r\nElectrical cardioversion restores sinus rhythm using a synchronised shock and is the treatment of choice in emergency AF with compromised haemodynamics.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Anticoagulation with warfarin\r\n\r\nWhile anticoagulation is important in AF to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, it does not address the acute haemodynamic instability.

It is not appropriate for managing acute new-onset AF with haemodynamic instability.\r\n\r\nD) Rate control with diltiazem\r\n\r\nRate control is appropriate for stable patients with AF. However, in this case, rate control alone would be too slow and insufficient, given the degree of haemodynamic compromise. Furthermore, intravenous diltiazem may worsen hypotension or compromise cardiac output in unstable patients.\r\n\r\nE) Rhythm control with flecainide\r\n\r\nFlecainide is a Class Ic antiarrhythmic and is contraindicated in structural heart disease or ischaemia, and should not be used in haemodynamically unstable patients. Also, chemical cardioversion is slower than electrical cardioversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a classic case of unstable AF where the patient is rapidly deteriorating. NICE and BNF advise urgent electrical cardioversion as first-line in unstable cases, to immediately restore sinus rhythm and stabilise the patient. Anticoagulation may follow after stabilisation depending on stroke risk.",

    "text": "A 35-year-old man with schizophrenia has been taking clozapine 400 mg daily for the past year. He is a heavy smoker (40 cigarettes per day) and wants to quit smoking. He attends a smoking cessation clinic and is prescribed nicotine patches.",
    "why": "D. Reduce the dose and monitor plasma levels weekly\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSmoking induces the activity of the hepatic enzyme CYP1A2, which plays a major role in the metabolism of clozapine. When smoking is stopped, the enzyme's activity decreases, leading to reduced clearance of clozapine and an increase in its plasma concentration. This raises the risk of dose-related adverse effects such as sedation, seizures, or even life-threatening clozapine toxicity. To prevent this, the dose of clozapine should be reduced, and plasma levels should be monitored weekly during the smoking cessation process.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Increase the dose and monitor plasma levels weekly: \r\n\r\nIncreasing the dose during smoking cessation would exacerbate the risk of clozapine toxicity due to the reduced metabolism by CYP1A2.\r\n\r\nB. Increase the dose and monitor plasma levels daily: \r\n\r\nSimilar to option A, increasing the dose is inappropriate during smoking cessation and could lead to toxic plasma levels.\r\n\r\nC. Keep the dose unchanged and monitor plasma levels weekly: \r\n\r\nWhile weekly monitoring is prudent, leaving the dose unchanged ignores the reduced clearance caused by smoking cessation, putting the patient at risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\nE. Reduce the dose and monitor plasma levels monthly: \r\n\r\nReducing the dose is correct, but monthly monitoring is insufficient given the dynamic changes in clozapine plasma levels during smoking cessation. Frequent monitoring (e.g., weekly) is necessary to ensure safe and effective adjustments.\r\n\r\nClozapine is primarily metabolised by the CYP1A2 enzyme, whose activity is induced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke. Stopping smoking can significantly reduce CYP1A2 activity, leading to increased plasma concentrations of clozapine. To mitigate the risk of toxicity, the dose of clozapine should be gradually reduced, and plasma levels should be monitored weekly during smoking cessation. NICE guidelines emphasise that patients undergoing smoking cessation while on clozapine should have their treatment closely monitored, with regular assessment of plasma levels, side effects, and mental state to ensure optimal management.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 54-year-old man with type 2 diabetes needs to commence insulin treatment and would like to use an insulin preparation that is injected subcutaneously only once daily at bedtime.",
    "why": "B) Levemir (insulin detemir)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025), the preferred basal insulin for type 2 diabetes is NPH insulin (isophane insulin, e.g., Humulin I). However, for patients who require a once-daily bedtime insulin regimen, a long-acting insulin analogue like insulin detemir (Levemir) or insulin glargine is recommended.\r\n\r\nNICE specifically states that insulin detemir can be given once daily at bedtime, making it the most suitable choice in this case. It provides consistent glucose control with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to NPH insulin. Insulin degludec (Tresiba) is not routinely recommended by NICE for type 2 diabetes due to its high cost and lack of significant additional benefits over detemir or glargine.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Humulin I (isophane insulin)\r\n\r\nIntermediate-acting insulin, recommended first-line for basal insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes.\r\nTypically requires twice-daily dosing, so it may not be the best choice if the patient specifically wants a once-daily bedtime insulin.\r\nIf once-daily insulin is required, a long-acting analogue (e.g., insulin detemir) is preferred.\r\n\r\nC) NovoMix 30 (biphasic insulin aspart)\r\n\r\nPremixed insulin containing both rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin.\r\nUsed before meals, not at bedtime.\r\nNot suitable as a once-daily basal insulin because it also covers mealtime insulin needs.\r\n\r\nD) Tresiba (insulin degludec)\r\n\r\nUltra-long-acting insulin (>42 hours duration).\r\nProvides stable blood glucose control, but NICE does not recommend it for routine use in type 2 diabetes due to high cost and lack of significant clinical benefit over detemir or glargine.\r\nOnly considered in special cases, such as patients with severe hypoglycaemia or adherence issues.\r\n\r\nE) Velosulin (soluble insulin)\r\n\r\nShort-acting insulin, used before meals.\r\nNot suitable as a once-daily bedtime insulin.\r\n\r\nSummary of Insulin Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes:\r\n\r\nInsulin therapy in type 2 diabetes is initiated when oral antidiabetic agents (e.g., metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors) no longer provide adequate glucose control. \r\nNPH insulin (isophane insulin) is the first-line choice, but long-acting analogues like insulin detemir or insulin glargine can be used if the patient requires fewer injections or has a high risk of hypoglycaemia. Ultra-long-acting insulins like insulin degludec (Tresiba) are not routinely recommended by NICE due to cost concerns.",

    "why": "D) Increased risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin can increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by altering gut flora that produce vitamin K or through interactions that reduce the metabolism of warfarin. This leads to an elevated international normalised ratio (INR), increasing the risk of bleeding. Patients on warfarin who are prescribed antibiotics like amoxicillin require close monitoring of their INR to ensure it remains within the therapeutic range.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic: Amoxicillin absorption is not significantly affected by warfarin or related factors.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant: Amoxicillin increases rather than decreases the effect of warfarin.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive: This interaction is irrelevant since hormonal contraceptives are not involved.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia: There is no known interaction between amoxicillin and warfarin affecting potassium levels.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: This is not a risk associated with either drug in this combination.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension: Neither drug in this scenario directly impacts blood pressure.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome: This is not relevant as neither amoxicillin nor warfarin are serotonergic drugs.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend careful INR monitoring in patients on warfarin who are prescribed antibiotics. Amoxicillin and other penicillins can potentiate warfarin\u2019s anticoagulant effects, increasing bleeding risk. Patients should be advised to report any signs of bleeding, such as bruising, haematuria, or unusual bleeding. Adjustments to the warfarin dose may be required based on INR results.\r\n\r\nAlthough penicillin is listed under the allergy section, the recorded reaction is diarrhoea, this is a side effect (intolerance), not a true allergy. True allergy involves immune-mediated reactions like rash, urticaria, or anaphylaxis. As such, prescribing amoxicillin in this case may be clinically appropriate if the benefit outweighs the risk, and the prescriber has assessed this.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: B) Increased risk of tendon rupture\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe combination of levofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone antibiotic) and corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) is known to increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture, particularly in older adults. This is a well-documented adverse interaction. \r\n\r\nIn this 93-year-old patient, the interaction presents a clinically significant risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) Increased risk of QT interval \u2013 Incorrect. While levofloxacin alone may prolong the QT interval, prednisolone does not contribute to this risk, so it is not the primary concern for this specific interaction.\r\n\r\nC) Increased risk of seizures \u2013 Incorrect. Fluoroquinolones can lower the seizure threshold, but this is not amplified by corticosteroids, making this less relevant in the context of this combination.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of photosensitivity \u2013 Incorrect. Levofloxacin can cause photosensitivity, but this is not significantly worsened by corticosteroids.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hepatotoxicity \u2013 Incorrect. Hepatotoxicity is not a common interaction between levofloxacin and prednisolone.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of resistance \u2013 Incorrect. This risk relates to antibiotic overuse, not to the combination with corticosteroids.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypoglycemia \u2013 Incorrect. Hypoglycemia is associated with fluoroquinolones but is more commonly seen with co-administration of antidiabetic medications, not corticosteroids.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of nephrotoxicity \u2013 Incorrect. This combination does not significantly increase nephrotoxicity risk.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n* Tendonitis and tendon rupture are serious and well-recognised risks of fluoroquinolones, especially when combined with systemic corticosteroids.\r\n* Elderly patients are particularly vulnerable.\r\n* Patients should be advised to report any tendon pain or swelling and stop treatment if symptoms occur.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 50-year-old woman with pyelonephritis is prescribed intravenous gentamicin 5 mg/kg once daily. Her serum creatinine is 90 micromol/L and her weight is 60 kg. She receives her first dose of gentamicin at 8 am on day 1. Her serum gentamicin levels are measured at 9 am and 7 pm on day 2. The results are as follows:\r\n\r\n- 9 am: 9.2 mg/L\r\n- 7 pm: 0.9 mg/L",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA. Continue the same dose and frequency of gentamicin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient is on a once-daily extended-interval gentamicin regimen, which requires both peak and trough monitoring if nomograms aren't used.\r\n\r\n- Target peak (1 hour post-dose): 5\u201310 mg/L\r\n\r\n- Target trough (just before next dose): <1 mg/L\r\n\r\n- Although her levels were taken later than standard times, the peak of 9.2 mg/L and trough of 0.9 mg/L are within therapeutic range, so there is no need to change the dose or frequency.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB. Decrease the dose of gentamicin to 4 mg/kg once daily\r\n\r\nThis would reduce peak levels, risking subtherapeutic efficacy, especially for a serious infection like pyelonephritis. Her current peak (9.2 mg/L) is appropriate, so dose reduction is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nC. Decrease the frequency of gentamicin to every 36 hours\r\n\r\nReserved for renal impairment or slow clearance when trough remains high. Her trough is already <1 mg/L, meaning she's clearing the drug well. Extending the interval risks underdosing.\r\n\r\nD. Increase the dose of gentamicin to 6 mg/kg once daily\r\n\r\nThis may push the peak level above the safe range (>10 mg/L), increasing the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Her current dose is achieving the desired peak (9.2 mg/L), so increasing it would be unsafe.\r\n\r\nE. Increase the frequency to every 12 hours\r\n\r\nNot recommended in once-daily gentamicin protocols. More frequent dosing is associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity, and her current levels show no need for such intensification.\r\n\r\n\r\n- This patient\u2019s gentamicin levels are therapeutic (peak and trough both within range). For once-daily aminoglycoside regimens, the aim is to balance efficacy (adequate peak) and safety (low trough).\r\nThe most appropriate action is to continue the same dose and frequency.",

    "text": "A 50-year-old man with schizophrenia has been taking an antipsychotic medication for the past 2 years. He visits the pharmacy for a repeat prescription and tells you that he has been experiencing involuntary movements of his face and body, such as grimacing, tongue protrusion, and twisting of his neck. He says that he is very embarrassed by these movements and wants to switch to another antipsychotic medication that has less impact on his motor function",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Haloperidol\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nHaloperidol is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic that strongly blocks dopamine D2 receptors, especially in the nigrostriatal pathway, which regulates movement. This leads to a high incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), including:\r\n\r\nAcute dystonia\r\n\r\nPseudoparkinsonism\r\n\r\nAkathisia\r\n\r\nTardive dyskinesia (involuntary facial and limb movements, often irreversible)\r\n\r\nEPS are more common and severe with typical antipsychotics like haloperidol, particularly with long-term use, as seen in this patient.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Aripiprazole\r\nAn atypical antipsychotic with partial dopamine agonist activity. It has lower risk of EPS and may actually help reduce tardive dyskinesia symptoms in some patients.\r\n\r\nB) Clozapine\r\nHas minimal extrapyramidal side effects and is often reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It is particularly useful in patients who experience EPS on other agents. However, requires close monitoring for agranulocytosis.\r\n\r\nD) Quetiapine\r\nAnother atypical antipsychotic with low D2 binding. It has minimal EPS risk, making it a reasonable alternative if motor side effects are problematic.\r\n\r\nE) Risperidone\r\nThough it is an atypical antipsychotic, at higher doses (>6 mg/day) it becomes more dopamine-blocking and may cause moderate EPS, but it is still less likely than haloperidol.",

    "why": "E. Erythromycin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nErythromycin inhibits the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP1A2, which is responsible for metabolising theophylline. This inhibition increases plasma theophylline levels, resulting in toxicity, manifesting as symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and tremor.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amiodarone\r\n\r\nAmiodarone inhibits multiple CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, but it is not typically associated with clinically significant interactions with theophylline.\r\n\r\nB. Carbamazepine\r\n\r\nAn enzyme inducer that increases the metabolism of drugs like theophylline, potentially lowering its levels and reducing its effect. This would not lead to toxicity.\r\n\r\nC. Ciprofloxacin\r\n\r\nLike erythromycin, ciprofloxacin inhibits CYP1A2, potentially causing theophylline toxicity. However, erythromycin is more strongly associated with this interaction in practice.\r\n\r\nD. Digoxin\r\n\r\nDigoxin does not interact with theophylline significantly. Its toxic effects are cardiac-related and not linked to CYP enzyme interactions.\r\n\r\nF. Fluoxetine\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP enzymes but primarily affects CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 rather than CYP1A2, making interactions with theophylline unlikely.\r\n\r\nG. Grapefruit juice\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP3A4, not CYP1A2, so it does not significantly affect theophylline metabolism.\r\n\r\nH. Warfarin\r\n\r\nWhile it interacts with many drugs, warfarin does not affect theophylline metabolism.\r\n\r\nTheophylline is a bronchodilator commonly used in asthma and COPD management, metabolised primarily by the liver enzyme CYP1A2. Certain medications, such as erythromycin and ciprofloxacin, inhibit CYP1A2, leading to reduced clearance of theophylline. This increases plasma levels and the risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\nSigns of theophylline toxicity include:\r\n\r\nGastrointestinal symptoms: nausea and vomiting.\r\nNeurological effects: tremors, agitation, or seizures.\r\nCardiovascular effects: arrhythmias or tachycardia in severe cases.\r\nPatients prescribed theophylline should be closely monitored when initiating or discontinuing interacting medications. Regular measurement of plasma theophylline levels is recommended, and patients should be educated to recognise early symptoms of toxicity and seek medical attention promptly.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She visits a travel clinic and is advised to take atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride as malaria prophylaxis for her trip. She is given a prescription for 23 tablets of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride 250 mg/100 mg. She asks you how to take the tablets and what precautions to follow.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE. She should take one tablet daily with food, starting 1\u20132 days before entering the malaria-endemic area and continuing for 1 week after leaving\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAtovaquone with proguanil is used for malaria prophylaxis and is especially suitable for shorter trips like this one. According to the BNF and NHS Fit for Travel, it should be taken once daily, starting 1\u20132 days before travel, continued throughout the stay, and for 7 days after leaving the malaria area. It must be taken with food or a milky drink to improve absorption.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Starting 1\u20132 weeks before is too early\r\n\r\nThis timing applies to mefloquine, not atovaquone/proguanil. Atovaquone/proguanil only needs to be started 1\u20132 days before entering the malaria area. Taking it too early doesn\u2019t increase effectiveness and could lead to unnecessary exposure to side effects.\r\n\r\nB. Taken on an empty stomach reduces absorption\r\n\r\nWhile the timing here is correct (1\u20132 days before and 7 days after), taking the tablet on an empty stomach is incorrect. Absorption of atovaquone is significantly reduced without food, which compromises protection against malaria.\r\n\r\nC. Four weeks after travel is too long for this medicine\r\n\r\nThis post-travel continuation is appropriate for doxycycline or mefloquine, but not for atovaquone/proguanil. \r\nThe correct post-travel continuation for atovaquone/proguanil is 7 days, not 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nD. Taken on an empty stomach and too early\r\n\r\nThis option is incorrect both in how and when the medicine is taken. It should be started just 1\u20132 days before travel, and it must be taken with food to work properly. Both elements here are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtovaquone/proguanil is a first-line option for malaria prevention in travellers visiting areas like Ghana. \r\nIt\u2019s easy to use, has a short lead-in and post-travel schedule, and works well if taken correctly with food. \r\nAlways check travel dates carefully and advise patients to finish the full course after returning to avoid late-onset malaria.",

Her HbA1c is 7.8% (62 mmol/mol) and she has no other comorbidities or complications.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB) Dapagliflozin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. NICE and MHRA guidance advise temporary discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors in acutely unwell patients due to the risk of euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, which can present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, breathlessness, confusion, or fatigue. This can occur even when blood glucose is normal, making it harder to detect. In this case, the patient is unwell with an infection, so dapagliflozin should be stopped immediately.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) All medicines must be stopped\r\n\r\nOnly dapagliflozin needs to be stopped. Other medicines can usually be continued with monitoring, unless there is poor oral intake or renal deterioration.\r\n\r\nC) Gliclazide\r\n\r\nSulfonylureas like gliclazide may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia but are not associated with DKA and do not need to be routinely stopped in unwell patients unless oral intake is poor.\r\n\r\nD) Metformin\r\n\r\nMetformin is not associated with DKA. It may need to be withheld if renal function deteriorates due to the risk of lactic acidosis, but that is not the immediate concern here.\r\n\r\nE) No medicines should be stopped\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Dapagliflozin should be stopped immediately due to the acute illness and risk of atypical DKA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin can cause euglycaemic DKA, especially during acute illness, dehydration, or reduced oral intake. MHRA guidance recommends that these medicines should be temporarily stopped in unwell patients to prevent DKA.

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) 2.5\u20133.5\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPatients with a mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic position are considered to have a moderate risk of thromboembolism. According to the BNF and national anticoagulation guidance, the recommended INR target range is 2.5\u20133.5. The presence of atrial fibrillation does not change this INR range for patients with mechanical heart valves, as the higher risk is already accounted for by the prosthetic valve.\r\nMechanical valves in the mitral position or those with higher-risk factors may require even higher INR targets, but this is not the case here.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor patients with mechanical heart valves, the INR target range depends on the valve type and position. Aortic valves typically require a range of 2.5\u20133.5, while mitral valves or those with additional risk factors may need 3.0\u20134.0 or higher. Atrial fibrillation alone does not alter the INR target for valve patients. Regular monitoring is essential to prevent both thromboembolic events and bleeding complications.",

    "text": "A 60-year-old male patient with severe heart failure is experiencing nausea and vomiting.",
    "why": "Domperidone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDomperidone is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III\u2013IV) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%). This is because domperidone has been associated with an increased risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, which can exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions. Due to its prokinetic action, domperidone may also interfere with cardiac conduction pathways, further heightening the risk in patients with severe heart failure.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, alternative antiemetics should be considered to avoid worsening the patient\u2019s cardiac condition.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Metoclopramide\r\n\r\nMetoclopramide is generally safe to use in patients with heart failure and is effective for nausea and vomiting, especially when caused by delayed gastric emptying or gastrointestinal stasis. However, it should be used with caution in patients prone to extrapyramidal side effects.\r\n\r\nC: Nabilone\r\n\r\nNabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, is used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and does not have significant cardiac risks. It is not commonly used for heart failure-associated nausea.\r\n\r\nD: Ondansetron\r\n\r\nOndansetron is effective and generally safe in heart failure patients. However, caution is advised due to its potential to prolong the QT interval, particularly in patients with existing risk factors for arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nE: Prochlorperazine\r\n\r\nProchlorperazine is an antipsychotic with antiemetic properties. While it may cause mild QT prolongation, it does not carry the same level of risk as domperidone for patients with heart failure.\r\n\r\nPatients with heart failure may experience nausea and vomiting due to the condition itself, medication side effects (e.g., digoxin), or comorbidities. According to the BNF, antiemetics such as domperidone are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe heart failure due to the risk of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Alternative options include metoclopramide or ondansetron, which should be selected based on the underlying cause of nausea and the patient's overall clinical profile. Careful consideration of cardiac status and monitoring for adverse effects are essential when prescribing antiemetics in this population.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "A. Amiodarone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSimvastatin is metabolised by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and amiodarone is a CYP3A4 inhibitor. When amiodarone is taken concurrently with simvastatin, it increases simvastatin plasma concentrations, raising the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The patient\u2019s symptoms of muscle pain and weakness are consistent with statin-induced myopathy, exacerbated by this interaction.\r\n\r\nThe MHRA recommends that the dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg/day when used with amiodarone, to reduce the risk of myopathy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amiodarone\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP3A4 metabolism of simvastatin, increasing plasma levels and the risk of myopathy.\r\n\r\nB. Carbamazepine\r\n\r\nCarbamazepine is a CYP3A4 inducer, which would reduce simvastatin levels, not increase them. This interaction does not explain the patient\u2019s muscle pain.\r\n\r\nC. Ciprofloxacin\r\n\r\nCiprofloxacin can increase the risk of tendinopathy but does not interact with simvastatin to cause myopathy. It is not a significant CYP3A4 inhibitor.\r\n\r\nD. Digoxin\r\n\r\nDigoxin does not interact with simvastatin. Its interactions are typically with drugs that affect P-glycoprotein transporters.\r\n\r\nE. Erythromycin\r\n\r\nErythromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which can increase simvastatin levels and risk of myopathy. However, in this scenario, amiodarone is the new medication prescribed, not erythromycin.\r\n\r\nF. Fluoxetine\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and does not interact with simvastatin via the CYP3A4 pathway.\r\n\r\nG. Grapefruit juice\r\n\r\nGrapefruit juice is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and can interact with simvastatin. However, it is not the medication introduced in this scenario.\r\n\r\nH. Warfarin\r\n\r\nSimvastatin can potentiate the effects of warfarin, but this interaction does not lead to muscle pain or weakness.\r\n\r\nStatins such as simvastatin can cause myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, particularly when combined with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, erythromycin, grapefruit juice).\r\nDose adjustments are recommended to minimise this risk. For simvastatin, the maximum dose when combined with amiodarone is 20 mg/day.\r\n\r\nKey Learning Point:\r\n\r\nPharmacists must monitor for signs of myopathy (e.g., muscle pain and weakness) in patients prescribed simvastatin alongside CYP3A4 inhibitors. Dose adjustments or switching to an alternative statin like pravastatin or rosuvastatin (not metabolised by CYP3A4) may be necessary.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "B. Report: Black triangle medicine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nBempedoic acid is a black triangle medicine, which means it is subject to intensive monitoring for any side effects. This classification indicates that any adverse reactions should be reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme for pharmacovigilance. Nausea and vomiting, while not uncommon side effects of bempedoic acid, must still be reported because all adverse reactions to black triangle medicines need to be documented to monitor the drug\u2019s safety profile.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction: While nausea and vomiting are known side effects of bempedoic acid, the drug is classified as a black triangle medicine, meaning any side effects, even common ones, should be reported.\r\n\r\nC. Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction: This is not relevant in this case because nausea and vomiting are acute reactions, not delayed ones.\r\n\r\nD. Report: Herbal or Homoeopathic medicine: Bempedoic acid is not an herbal or homeopathic medicine; it is a prescription medication.\r\n\r\nE. Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction: Nausea and vomiting, while unpleasant, are generally not considered serious or life-threatening reactions unless accompanied by other complications such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\r\n\r\nF. Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine: There is no indication that the bempedoic acid in this case is counterfeit or defective.\r\n\r\nG. Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine: The scenario does not involve misuse or abuse of the medication.\r\n\r\nH. Report: Vaccine reaction: This is irrelevant as the patient is on a prescribed medication, not a vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MHRA Yellow Card Scheme is an essential part of pharmacovigilance in the UK, allowing healthcare professionals and patients to report adverse drug reactions (ADRs). When a medication is classified as a black triangle medicine, like bempedoic acid, it indicates that the drug is still undergoing intensive monitoring for safety, and all adverse effects, including those that are known, must be reported. This process helps to ensure patient safety by collecting data on side effects to adjust recommendations and improve the medication's risk profile. As outlined by NICE and the MHRA, it is crucial to report even non-serious side effects for these medicines to aid in the continued monitoring of their safety.\r\n\r\nFor further information, you can refer to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 - 16 (MHRA) :\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 55-year-old man with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 is prescribed perindopril 4 mg once daily by his GP. He has no other medical conditions or allergies. He visits his community pharmacist to collect his prescription and notices that there is a cautionary and advisory label on the box of his medication.",
    "why": "E. Label 22: Take 30 to 60 minutes before food\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\nPerindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) that works by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, lowering blood pressure. To ensure optimal absorption and bioavailability, it should be taken on an empty stomach, preferably 30 to 60 minutes before food. Therefore, Label 22 is the most appropriate advisory label for perindopril.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Label 1: Warning: This medicine may make you sleepy\r\n\r\nThis label is incorrect because perindopril does not typically cause sleepiness. The side effects of ACE inhibitors more commonly include dizziness or light-headedness, especially after the first dose, rather than sedation.\r\n\r\nB. Label 2: Warning: This medicine may make you sleepy. If this happens, do not drive or use tools or machines. Do not drink alcohol\r\n\r\nThis label is also inappropriate. While alcohol should generally be avoided with many medications, perindopril does not cause sleepiness or sedation. The caution about alcohol is not specific to perindopril.\r\n\r\nC. Label 3: Warning: This medicine may make you sleepy. If this happens, do not drive or use tools or machines\r\n\r\nLike Label 2, this is not relevant for perindopril because sleepiness is not a common side effect of the drug. Dizziness can occur, but it\u2019s not typically related to sleepiness.\r\n\r\nD. Label 4: Warning: Do not drink alcohol\r\n\r\nWhile alcohol should be used cautiously with many medications, including some antihypertensives, perindopril does not have a significant interaction with alcohol that requires this warning. Therefore, this label is not the most appropriate.\r\n\r\nSmall Paragraph on the Topic:\r\n\r\nPerindopril is an ACE inhibitor prescribed for conditions like hypertension and chronic kidney disease. It lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. For optimal absorption, perindopril should be taken on an empty stomach, ideally 30 to 60 minutes before meals, to avoid food interfering with its effectiveness. Although dizziness may occur, particularly after the first dose, perindopril does not typically cause sleepiness, so cautionary labels related to drowsiness are not relevant. Proper usage, including adherence to timing before meals, is essential to maximise the therapeutic benefit of the medication.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB) Stop taking on the day of admission\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Metformin should generally be withheld upon hospital admission, particularly in patients with acute illness, infections, or risk of dehydration, as these conditions can increase the risk of lactic acidosis, a rare but serious side effect of metformin.\r\n\r\n- In this scenario, the patient has a urinary tract infection, which may compromise renal function or hydration status, thereby increasing the risk. Therefore, it is appropriate to stop metformin on admission and reassess once the patient stabilises.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Continue taking as normal \u2013 Not appropriate during acute illness, especially infections, due to risk of lactic acidosis.\r\n\r\nC) Stop taking 48 hours before admission \u2013 This applies before procedures involving contrast media, not for general hospital admissions.\r\n\r\nD) Stop taking on the day of discharge \u2013 Delaying discontinuation would increase the risk of complications during hospital stay.\r\n\r\nE) Reduce the dose by half \u2013 There is no standard recommendation to reduce by half. Metformin should be stopped altogether if risk factors for lactic acidosis are present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMetformin should be stopped on the day of admission if a patient is acutely unwell, has an infection, or is at risk of renal impairment or dehydration.

Reporting ensures pharmacovigilance for products outside conventional medicine.\r\n\r\nWhy Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA) Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction \u2013 This would apply if the reaction were from a conventional drug with a well-documented safety profile, but Thuja occidentalis falls under herbal/homoeopathic products.\r\n\r\nB) Report: Black triangle medicine \u2013 Black triangle medicines are newly licensed medicines requiring close monitoring; this does not apply to herbal or homoeopathic products.\r\n\r\nC) Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction \u2013 Delayed reactions occur after prolonged use or exposure, which is not applicable here.\r\n\r\nE) Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction \u2013 The reaction described (rash) is not life-threatening.\r\n\r\nF) Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine \u2013 This applies to concerns about the authenticity or quality of the product, not an adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nG) Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine \u2013 There is no evidence of misuse in this scenario.\r\n\r\nH) Report: Vaccine reaction \u2013 The case does not involve a vaccine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbal or Homoeopathic medicine. Adverse reactions to complementary medicines should be reported to the Yellow Card Scheme to maintain safety and public health monitoring. This ensures any emerging risks related to herbal or homoeopathic remedies are effectively managed and communicated.\r\n\r\nFor more information, you can visit the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 - 16 (MHRA) :\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Every 6 months\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the NICE guideline NG28 (Type 2 Diabetes in Adults, 2023 update):\r\n\r\n- People with type 2 diabetes who are stable and on two or more antidiabetic drugs (e.g. metformin + gliclazide) should have their HbA1c monitored every 6 months.\r\n\r\n- If there is unstable control, recent changes to therapy, or intercurrent illness, more frequent checks (e.g. every 3 months) may be needed.\r\n\r\n- This patient has stable control, no hypoglycaemia, and is on dual therapy, making 6-monthly monitoring appropriate.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Every month\r\n\r\n\u2192 Too frequent.

Would delay detection of deteriorating control or treatment failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHbA1c measures average blood glucose over 2\u20133 months.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE NG28:\r\n\r\n- Test every 6 months for people on stable antidiabetic therapy\r\n\r\n- Test every 3 months if HbA1c is changing rapidly, if treatment has been changed recently, or if glucose control is unstable\r\n\r\n- Use HbA1c to monitor long-term control and inform treatment decisions",

    "text": "A 32-year-old woman who is 16 weeks pregnant and just been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism.",
    "why": "Carbimazole\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy, the treatment of hyperthyroidism is carefully tailored to balance maternal health while minimising fetal risk. According to NICE guidelines and the BNF, propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital malformations associated with carbimazole. However, after the first trimester (12 weeks), carbimazole is preferred due to the risk of liver toxicity associated with long-term use of PTU.\r\n\r\nAt 16 weeks of pregnancy, this patient has entered the second trimester, making carbimazole the most appropriate treatment. It effectively controls maternal thyroid hormone levels while posing less risk to both the mother and fetus during the second and third trimesters.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Iodide with iodine\r\n\r\nIodide and iodine are not recommended during pregnancy as they can interfere with fetal thyroid function and increase the risk of goitre or hypothyroidism in the fetus.\r\n\r\nC: Liothyronine\r\n\r\nLiothyronine is used for hypothyroidism or in combination with levothyroxine in certain conditions. It is not appropriate for the treatment of hyperthyroidism.\r\n\r\nD: Levothyroxine\r\n\r\nLevothyroxine is used for hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, and is therefore not suitable in this case.\r\n\r\nE: Propylthiouracil (PTU)\r\n\r\nPTU is the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism during the first trimester to minimise the risk of teratogenic effects of carbimazole. After 12 weeks, PTU is typically replaced by carbimazole to avoid long-term risks of liver toxicity.\r\n\r\nThe management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy requires careful selection of treatment to optimise maternal and fetal outcomes. According to NICE guidelines and the BNF, propylthiouracil (PTU) is recommended during the first trimester to reduce the risk of teratogenicity associated with carbimazole. From the second trimester onward, carbimazole is preferred as it poses a lower risk of maternal hepatotoxicity associated with PTU. Close monitoring of thyroid function is essential throughout pregnancy to adjust treatment and maintain maternal thyroid hormones within target ranges. Untreated or poorly controlled hyperthyroidism can lead to complications such as preterm labour, low birth weight, or preeclampsia, underscoring the importance of timely and appropriate treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "**Theme: Drug interactions**\r\n\r\n**Instruction: For each of the following scenarios, select the most appropriate drug from the list of options that interacts with the drug mentioned in the scenario. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**",
    "why": "B. Carbamazepine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCarbamazepine (B) is a potent enzyme inducer, specifically of CYP450 enzymes, including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which metabolise phenytoin. This induction increases phenytoin metabolism, leading to reduced plasma concentrations and subtherapeutic levels despite good adherence. Additionally, phenytoin can reduce the plasma levels of carbamazepine, further complicating management in patients requiring both drugs.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amiodarone\r\n\r\nInhibits several CYP enzymes, including CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, which would increase phenytoin levels rather than reduce them.\r\n\r\nC. Ciprofloxacin\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 but does not significantly interact with phenytoin metabolism.\r\n\r\nD. Digoxin\r\n\r\nNo interaction with phenytoin related to metabolism. Its pharmacokinetics are unrelated to CYP450 enzymes, and the scenario does not mention digoxin-specific effects.\r\n\r\nE. Erythromycin\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP3A4, which could increase phenytoin levels rather than reduce them.\r\n\r\nF. Fluoxetine\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which might increase phenytoin levels. However, it has no relevance to the scenario of subtherapeutic levels.\r\n\r\nG. Grapefruit juice\r\n\r\nInhibits CYP3A4 but does not induce enzymes or affect phenytoin levels in the context of this scenario.\r\n\r\nH. Warfarin\r\n\r\nPhenytoin can reduce the effect of warfarin due to enzyme induction, but warfarin itself does not affect phenytoin metabolism.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrug Interactions with Phenytoin\r\n\r\nPhenytoin is an anti-epileptic drug metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Carbamazepine, a commonly used medication for conditions like trigeminal neuralgia, is a CYP enzyme inducer. This induction increases the metabolism of phenytoin, leading to subtherapeutic plasma levels and reduced efficacy, even in adherent patients.\r\n\r\nConversely, phenytoin can induce enzymes that metabolise carbamazepine, causing reduced carbamazepine plasma levels. Co-administration of these two drugs requires careful monitoring of serum levels and dosage adjustments to maintain therapeutic efficacy and avoid treatment failure.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "title": "A patient taking lithium for bipolar disorder has a toxic serum level after being prescribed a medicine for heart failure",
    "text": "**Theme: Drug interactions**\r\n\r\n**Instruction: For each of the following scenarios, select the most appropriate drug from the list of options that interacts with the drug mentioned in the scenario. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**",
    "why": "F. Furosemide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFurosemide, a loop diuretic, can cause hyponatraemia by increasing sodium excretion. Lithium and sodium are reabsorbed in the renal tubules via similar pathways. When sodium levels drop, the kidney compensates by increasing lithium reabsorption, leading to elevated serum lithium levels and potential toxicity. This interaction is significant in patients with conditions such as heart failure, where furosemide is often prescribed.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amiodarone: Incorrect. Amiodarone is associated with thyroid dysfunction, which could indirectly affect mood stabilisers like lithium. However, it does not directly cause lithium toxicity.\r\n\r\nB. Carbamazepine: Incorrect. Carbamazepine has its own risk of hyponatraemia but is not typically used in heart failure.\r\n\r\nC. Ciprofloxacin: Incorrect. Ciprofloxacin can interact with other drugs affecting renal function but does not specifically exacerbate lithium toxicity.\r\n\r\nD. Digoxin: Incorrect. Digoxin interacts with other electrolyte-modulating drugs but does not affect lithium levels directly.\r\n\r\nE. Erythromycin: Incorrect. Erythromycin increases the levels of some drugs metabolised by cytochrome P450 but does not significantly interact with lithium.\r\n\r\nG. Grapefruit juice: Incorrect. Grapefruit juice can inhibit CYP enzymes but does not impact lithium levels, as lithium is renally excreted.\r\n\r\nH. Warfarin: Incorrect. Warfarin does not interact with lithium directly.\r\n\r\nLithium is a mood stabiliser primarily used for bipolar disorder. Its narrow therapeutic index necessitates careful monitoring of serum levels to prevent toxicity. Common causes of lithium toxicity include dehydration, renal impairment, and drug interactions that alter lithium clearance. Diuretics, particularly loop and thiazide diuretics, are significant culprits as they deplete sodium, leading to increased lithium reabsorption in the kidneys.\r\n\r\nPatients on lithium require regular serum level monitoring, and healthcare professionals must assess for potential drug interactions before prescribing. Symptoms of lithium toxicity range from mild (nausea, tremor) to severe (confusion, ataxia, seizures, coma). Treatment involves stopping lithium, rehydration, and in severe cases, haemodialysis.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines emphasise patient education on recognising toxicity signs, maintaining adequate hydration, and avoiding abrupt changes in sodium intake. Adjustments in lithium doses are critical during the introduction of interacting drugs like diuretics or NSAIDs. Regular renal function tests and monitoring of electrolyte levels are also recommended.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has read up about the medication online and he is worried about the risk of seizures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for Zyban has been provided for this question [SmPC for Zyban](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3827/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "A. Alcohol abuse\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAlcohol abuse is a known risk factor for seizures in patients taking Zyban (bupropion). According to the SmPC, bupropion lowers the seizure threshold, and alcohol abuse or sudden withdrawal from alcohol can further increase seizure risk. It is critical to monitor and counsel patients with a history of alcohol misuse when initiating treatment with bupropion.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Hypertension: While hypertension is a potential side effect of Zyban, it is not a direct risk factor for seizures. However, blood pressure should be monitored during treatment.\r\n\r\nC. Hypothyroidism: There is no evidence linking hypothyroidism to an increased risk of seizures with bupropion use.\r\n\r\nD. Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is unrelated to the seizure risk associated with bupropion.\r\n\r\nE. Rheumatoid arthritis: This condition does not influence seizure risk when taking Zyban.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines (NG209) on tobacco cessation recommend the use of bupropion (Zyban) as a pharmacological option for patients seeking to stop smoking when nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is unsuitable or ineffective. Careful patient assessment is necessary to identify risks, including the potential for seizures.\r\n\r\nPatients must be informed about the following:\r\n\r\nThe importance of adherence to the prescribed dose.\r\nAvoiding sudden cessation of alcohol use.\r\nMonitoring for side effects such as insomnia, dry mouth, or rare but serious adverse events like seizures.\r\nThis ensures a safe and structured approach to smoking cessation.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 15-year-old patient who comes into your community pharmacy with a prescription for co-amoxiclav and a stat dose of dexamethasone. From her PMR, you note that she is a type 1 diabetic currently using a regimen of insulin glargine once daily and Novorapid\u00ae when required. She tells you that she has felt so ill from her cold that she has not been able to eat.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Dry cough\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIn a type 1 diabetic patient who is unwell, certain symptoms indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hyperglycaemia, both of which require immediate medical attention. These include:\r\n\r\n- Confusion \u2013 Can indicate severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, or DKA.\r\n- Extreme thirst (Polydipsia) \u2013 A sign of uncontrolled hyperglycaemia, which may precede DKA.\r\n- Frequent urination (Polyuria) \u2013 Suggests high blood glucose levels and dehydration, a risk factor for DKA.\r\n- Vomiting \u2013 A critical symptom of DKA, often due to metabolic acidosis and dehydration.\r\n\r\nA dry cough, however, is not directly related to diabetes emergencies and does not require urgent medical attention unless accompanied by breathing difficulties, fever, or chest pain.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Confusion \r\n\r\nCan indicate severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, or DKA, requiring urgent intervention.\r\n\r\nC) Extreme thirst \r\n\r\nSuggests severe hyperglycaemia or dehydration, which may progress to DKA.\r\n\r\nD) Frequent urination \r\n\r\nA sign of uncontrolled diabetes and dehydration, potentially leading to DKA.\r\n\r\nE) Vomiting \r\n\r\nA key warning sign of DKA. Patients unable to retain fluids are at high risk of metabolic acidosis and require urgent care.\r\n\r\nWhen unwell, patients with type 1 diabetes are at risk of hyperglycaemia, dehydration, and DKA. NICE 2025 guidelines recommend following sick-day rules to prevent complications:\r\n\r\n1) Do not stop insulin \u2013 Even if you are unable to eat, continue taking insulin as prescribed.\r\n\r\n2) Monitor blood glucose levels more frequently \u2013 Check at least every 2\u20134 hours.\r\n\r\n3) Check ketones regularly \u2013 If blood glucose is consistently >11 mmol/L, test for ketones using urine or blood ketone strips.\r\n\r\n4) Stay hydrated \u2013 Drink plenty of fluids (sugar-free if blood glucose is high, sugary drinks if at risk of hypoglycaemia).\r\n\r\n5) Adjust insulin doses as needed \u2013 Increase rapid-acting insulin if blood glucose levels are high or ketones are present.\r\n\r\n6) Eat small, frequent meals \u2013 If unable to eat solid food, consume carbohydrate-containing drinks such as milk or soup.\r\n\r\n7) Seek urgent medical attention if:\r\n\r\n- You vomit more than once or cannot keep fluids down.\r\n- Blood glucose remains >15 mmol/L despite insulin adjustment.\r\n- Ketone levels are moderate to high.\r\n- You experience drowsiness, confusion, or difficulty breathing.\r\n\r\nDKA is a medical emergency that occurs when the body starts breaking down fat instead of glucose, producing toxic ketones. It is more common in illness, missed insulin doses, or infection. Early recognition and management of sick-day rules help prevent DKA and hospitalisation.\r\n\r\n\"Sick day\" refers to any period when a person with diabetes is unwell, particularly with infections, fever, vomiting, or any condition that can affect blood sugar control. During illness, the body's stress response releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which increase blood glucose levels and insulin resistance. This can lead to hyperglycaemia, dehydration, and diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, sick-day rules are a set of self-management guidelines that help prevent complications by ensuring that insulin is continued, blood glucose is monitored frequently, and appropriate adjustments are made to food and fluid intake.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

You suspect that he has dementia with Lewy bodies.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE) Rivastigmine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nRivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is specifically licensed for treating mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease and is commonly used in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). According to the BNF and NICE guidelines, it is the preferred treatment for Lewy body dementia, especially when associated with Parkinsonian features.\r\n\r\nDLB patients often present with:\r\n\r\n- Progressive cognitive decline\r\n\r\n- Fluctuating attention\r\n\r\n- Visual hallucinations\r\n\r\n- Parkinsonism symptoms\r\n\r\nRivastigmine improves cognition, daily function, and may help with neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., apathy, mood changes). It is also less likely to worsen motor symptoms compared to antipsychotics.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Donepezil\r\n\r\n\u2192 While effective for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and sometimes used off-label for DLB, it is not licensed specifically for dementia in Parkinson\u2019s disease or DLB. Rivastigmine has stronger evidence and a licence for this indication.\r\n\r\nB) Galantamine\r\n\r\n\u2192 Mainly used in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There is limited evidence for its use in DLB or Parkinson\u2019s-related dementia.\r\n\r\nC) Memantine\r\n\r\n\u2192 Used in moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but not first-line for DLB. It may be considered as add-on later if cholinesterase inhibitors are not sufficient or tolerated.\r\n\r\nD) Quetiapine\r\n\r\n\u2192 This is an antipsychotic sometimes cautiously used in Parkinson's patients for severe psychosis. However, antipsychotics carry significant risks in DLB, including worsening Parkinsonism and increased sensitivity, and are not a treatment for dementia itself.\r\n\r\n- Condition: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in a Parkinson\u2019s patient\r\n\r\n- Treatment of choice: Rivastigmine (licensed for this indication)\r\n\r\n- Why: Improves cognitive and behavioural symptoms without worsening motor function\r\n\r\nAvoid: Antipsychotics unless absolutely necessary due to risk of severe sensitivity reactions",

She complains of headache, flushing, and palpitations. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and her heart rate is 60 beats per minute.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE) Isosorbide mononitrate-induced vasodilation\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nIsosorbide mononitrate is a long-acting nitrate used in the management of chronic stable angina. It works by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation of both veins and arteries. This reduces myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing preload and afterload.\r\n\r\nThe common side effects of nitrates, as noted in the BNF, include:\r\n\r\n- Headache\r\n\r\n- Flushing\r\n\r\n- Palpitations (secondary to reflex tachycardia)\r\n\r\nThese are directly attributable to the vasodilatory effect.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Aspirin-induced platelet inhibition\r\n\r\nIncorrect. While aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, it does not cause headache, flushing, or palpitations. Its side effects are more related to GI upset or bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nB) Atenolol and aspirin interaction\r\n\r\nIncorrect. There is no clinically significant interaction between atenolol and aspirin that would explain these symptoms. They are often prescribed together in cardiovascular patients.\r\n\r\nC) Atenolol-induced bradycardia\r\n\r\nIncorrect. The patient's heart rate is 60 bpm, which is within normal resting range, especially for someone on a beta-blocker. Bradycardia would present more with fatigue or dizziness, not flushing and palpitations.\r\n\r\nD) Isosorbide mononitrate and atenolol interaction\r\n\r\nIncorrect. These drugs are often used together in angina management, and there is no specific interaction that would explain the described symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of headache, flushing, and palpitations are typical adverse effects of nitrate-induced vasodilation, particularly with isosorbide mononitrate.

    "text": "A 30-year-old pregnant patient with a history of depression and smoking addiction is considering taking Zyban 150mg prolonged-release tablets to aid smoking cessation.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for Zyban has been provided for this question [SmPC for Zyban](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3827/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "C. Zyban is contraindicated during pregnancy\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for Zyban advises against its use during pregnancy due to potential risks. Epidemiological studies suggest that maternal exposure to bupropion in the first trimester may increase the risk of congenital cardiovascular malformations, such as ventricular septal defects and left outflow tract heart defects. Although these findings are inconsistent across studies and animal studies do not indicate significant reproductive toxicity, Zyban is contraindicated during pregnancy. Pregnant women should be encouraged to quit smoking through non-pharmacological methods like behavioural support.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Zyban is safe to use during pregnancy: Incorrect. Zyban is contraindicated due to potential risks to the fetus.\r\n\r\nB. Zyban should only be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks: Incorrect. While this applies to some medications, Zyban's use is contraindicated during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nD. Zyban can be used during pregnancy only after the first trimester: Incorrect. There is no evidence supporting safer use in later trimesters, and Zyban remains contraindicated throughout pregnancy.\r\n\r\nE. Zyban can be used during pregnancy only after the second trimester: Incorrect. This is not supported by the SmPC or clinical guidelines.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends that pregnant women who smoke should be offered support to quit without pharmacotherapy, as behavioural support is the safest option during pregnancy. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can be considered if behavioural methods are insufficient, but Zyban (bupropion) and varenicline are contraindicated. Smoking cessation during pregnancy is crucial to reduce the risks of miscarriage, preterm birth, and low birth weight.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 15-year-old patient who comes into your community pharmacy with a prescription for co-amoxiclav and a stat dose of dexamethasone. From her PMR, you note that she is a type 1 diabetic currently using a regimen of insulin glargine once daily and Novorapid\u00ae when required.  \tThe patient asks you if the corticosteroid will affect her insulin requirement;",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) It may lead you to increase your insulin requirement.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCorticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, can cause hyperglycaemia by inducing insulin resistance and increasing hepatic glucose production. This effect is particularly relevant in patients with type 1 diabetes, as they lack endogenous insulin production to compensate for increased glucose levels. As a result, insulin requirements often increase to maintain glycaemic control.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) It may induce hypoglycaemia which you will need to monitor for \r\n\r\nCorticosteroids generally raise blood glucose levels rather than lowering them. While hypoglycaemia can occur due to fluctuating insulin needs, the primary concern is hyperglycaemia.\r\n\r\nC) It may lead you to reduce your insulin requirement \r\n\r\nCorticosteroids increase insulin resistance, meaning that more insulin is required rather than less.\r\n\r\nD) It may cause a variable response in insulin requirement \r\n\r\nPartially correct but not the best answer. While individual responses may vary, the most common and expected outcome is an increase in insulin requirement.\r\n\r\nE) There will be no overall effect on insulin requirement \r\n\r\nCorticosteroids consistently raise blood glucose levels, leading to increased insulin requirements in most patients.\r\n\r\nCorticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, can cause steroid-induced hyperglycaemia by increasing hepatic glucose production and reducing insulin sensitivity. In patients with type 1 diabetes, this often leads to an increased insulin requirement to maintain glycaemic control. The effect is dose-dependent and typically more pronounced with longer courses of corticosteroids. According to NICE guidelines (2025), blood glucose levels should be closely monitored, and insulin doses should be adjusted accordingly to prevent hyperglycaemia and its complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "D) Increased risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIbuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of thromboxane A2, which is essential for platelet aggregation. When combined with apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, the anticoagulant effect of apixaban and the antiplatelet effect of ibuprofen significantly increase the risk of bleeding. Additionally, the patient is on bisoprolol, a beta blocker, which could mask symptoms of blood loss, such as tachycardia, complicating clinical monitoring.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic: Ibuprofen does not interfere with the absorption of antibiotics.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant: Ibuprofen does not decrease the efficacy of anticoagulants. Instead, it increases bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive: This is irrelevant in this scenario due to the patient\u2019s age and lack of reproductive contraception.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia: Hyperkalaemia is a known risk of NSAIDs but occurs primarily in patients with renal impairment or when combined with potassium-sparing drugs, which is not the case here.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: Ibuprofen does not cause hypoglycaemia. This is more relevant to insulin or sulfonylureas.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension: While bisoprolol can lower blood pressure, ibuprofen typically does not increase the risk of hypotension. However, NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of beta blockers by inhibiting prostaglandin-mediated vasodilation.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome is linked to serotonergic agents, not NSAIDs.\r\n\r\nThe combination of ibuprofen with apixaban requires caution due to the increased risk of bleeding. NICE guidelines recommend avoiding NSAIDs in patients on anticoagulants unless absolutely necessary. For elderly patients on beta blockers like bisoprolol, symptoms of bleeding (e.g., tachycardia) may be masked. Alternatives such as paracetamol should be considered for pain relief in this scenario. If ibuprofen must be used, co-prescription of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is advised to mitigate gastrointestinal risks. Regular monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as haematuria or gastrointestinal symptoms, is essential.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

You are reviewing their medical history for contraindications.\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for Zyban has been provided for this question [SmPC for Zyban](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3827/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "B. Bulimia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the SmPC for Zyban (bupropion), a history of bulimia or anorexia nervosa is a contraindication. Bupropion is associated with an increased risk of seizures, and eating disorders like bulimia further elevate this risk due to potential electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, Zyban should not be used in patients with a current or past history of bulimia or anorexia.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Brugada syndrome: Incorrect. While Brugada syndrome is a rare cardiac condition requiring specific management, it is not listed as a contraindication for Zyban. However, caution is advised when prescribing medications with potential cardiac effects.\r\n\r\nC. Depression: Incorrect. Zyban is often prescribed to patients with a history of depression, as bupropion is also an antidepressant. Depression is not a contraindication unless accompanied by another risk factor like seizures.\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes: Incorrect. Diabetes is not a contraindication, but it is a risk factor for seizures. Careful monitoring is recommended in diabetic patients taking Zyban.\r\n\r\nE. Hypertension: Incorrect. Hypertension is not a contraindication, but Zyban can increase blood pressure. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension should be treated with caution.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines for smoking cessation recommend the use of pharmacological aids like NRT, bupropion (Zyban), or varenicline in patients for whom behavioural support alone is insufficient. However, Zyban is contraindicated in individuals with:\r\n\r\nA history of bulimia or anorexia nervosa.\r\nSeizure disorders or conditions predisposing to seizures.\r\nSevere hepatic impairment.\r\nWhen prescribing Zyban, clinicians should assess individual risk factors for seizures and blood pressure control, monitoring patients regularly during treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Co-administration of erythromycin with carbamazepine can inhibit carbamazepine's metabolism, leading to increased serum levels and potential toxicity (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and ataxia).\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate action is to monitor serum levels of both drugs closely and adjust the dose of carbamazepine if necessary during the course of treatment with erythromycin.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Avoid\r\n\r\nWhile erythromycin increases the risk of carbamazepine toxicity, it is not strictly contraindicated. Monitoring and dose adjustments are usually sufficient to manage the interaction.\r\n\r\nC. No interaction\r\n\r\nThere is a significant interaction between erythromycin and carbamazepine due to CYP3A4 inhibition, which must be managed appropriately.\r\n\r\nD. Reduce dose\r\n\r\nDose reduction of carbamazepine might be necessary in some cases, but this should be guided by serum drug levels rather than being a pre-emptive action.\r\n\r\nE. Use with caution\r\n\r\nThis is not the most specific advice. While caution is always advisable, monitoring serum levels provides clearer guidance in this scenario.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of carbamazepine toxicity include confusion, drowsiness, nausea, and potentially more severe adverse effects if levels are not monitored.\r\nErythromycin is often used as part of the treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when atypical pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) are suspected.\r\n\r\nAlways assess potential drug interactions using a reliable reference (e.g., BNF, Stockley's Drug Interactions, or local protocols).\r\nCYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azole antifungals can increase the risk of toxicity for drugs metabolised by this pathway (e.g., carbamazepine, statins, or theophylline).\r\nMonitoring serum levels is crucial for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows, such as carbamazepine.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The patient also reports a history of smoking and dental extractions.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient has been taking alendronic acid (a bisphosphonate) for osteoporosis for 3 years and now presents with pain, swelling, and exposed bone in the mandible following dental procedures and a history of smoking. These are classic signs of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ).

Patients present with non-healing areas of exposed bone in the jaw, often accompanied by pain and swelling. Risk factors include long-term bisphosphonate use, smoking, poor dental hygiene, and invasive dental work. Early recognition is key to prevent progression.",

Insulin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nInsulin overdose due to incorrect product selection, device use, or use of abbreviations is listed as a Never Event by NHS England. Never Events are serious patient safety incidents that are entirely preventable if proper guidelines are followed. Insulin is classified as a high-risk medication because:\r\n\r\nDosing errors can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia.\r\nAbbreviating units (e.g., writing \"10U\" instead of \"10 units\") can result in tenfold dosing errors.\r\nThe use of different insulin types and delivery devices increases the risk of administration errors.\r\nMix-ups between long-acting and short-acting insulins can have severe consequences.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Adenosine\r\n\r\nUsed in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). While its administration requires caution, it is not classified as a Never Event risk due to overdose-related errors.\r\n\r\nB. Amiodarone\r\n\r\nA class III antiarrhythmic used in atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. It requires careful dosing and monitoring but is not associated with Never Events.\r\n\r\nC. Amphotericin\r\n\r\nAn antifungal medication used for systemic infections. Although there are different formulations (liposomal and conventional), which could lead to dosing errors, it is not listed as a Never Event drug.\r\n\r\nD. Ciclosporin\r\n\r\nAn immunosuppressant used in organ transplants and autoimmune conditions. Medication errors can occur, but overdose-related Never Events are not commonly associated with ciclosporin.\r\n\r\nE. Infliximab\r\n\r\nA TNF-alpha inhibitor used for conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It has a risk of severe immunosuppression and infusion reactions but is not classed as a Never Event medication.\r\n\r\nG. Phenytoin\r\n\r\nAn antiepileptic drug with a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that overdose can cause neurological toxicity. However, it is not specifically classified as a Never Event risk.\r\n\r\nH. Tacrolimus\r\n\r\nAnother immunosuppressant used in organ transplantation. Medication errors can occur due to different formulations, but it is not a Never Event medication for overdose errors.\r\n\r\nInsulin Safety & NHS England Never Events\r\n\r\nInsulin is a life-saving medication for diabetes management, but its narrow therapeutic index makes it prone to serious dosing errors. NHS England lists insulin-related overdoses due to wrong product selection, device misuse, or abbreviation errors as a Never Event to ensure stricter safety protocols.\r\n\r\nTo prevent insulin errors, NICE recommends:\r\n\r\nClearly writing \u2018units\u2019 instead of abbreviations like \u2018U\u2019 or \u2018IU\u2019.\r\nDouble-checking insulin types (e.g., long-acting vs. short-acting).\r\nEnsuring correct use of insulin pens and syringes.\r\nEducating patients and healthcare professionals about insulin safety.\r\n\r\nPlease watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 45-year-old female patient presents with symptoms of severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. The patient has been on carbimazole for hyperthyroidism.",
    "why": "Carbimazole-induced pancreatitis\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPancreatitis is a known, albeit rare, adverse effect of carbimazole, an antithyroid medication used for hyperthyroidism. The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and elevated serum amylase and lipase levels are consistent with acute pancreatitis. Given her current use of carbimazole, drug-induced pancreatitis is the most likely cause.\r\n\r\nCarbimazole-induced pancreatitis is a recognised adverse reaction, and NICE guidelines recommend discontinuing the medication immediately if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients should not be re-exposed to carbimazole, as rechallenge can lead to a severe or fatal recurrence.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Alcohol consumption\r\n\r\nWhile alcohol is one of the most common causes of acute pancreatitis, there is no indication in the patient's history to suggest alcohol-related pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nC: Gallstone obstruction\r\n\r\nGallstones are a leading cause of acute pancreatitis, but there is no mention of gallstones or biliary symptoms (e.g., jaundice, right upper quadrant pain) in this case.\r\n\r\nD: Hypertriglyceridemia\r\n\r\nHypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis, but the patient\u2019s history does not suggest elevated triglyceride levels or associated risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes.\r\n\r\nE: Viral infection\r\n\r\nViral infections, such as mumps or coxsackievirus, can lead to pancreatitis. However, this patient\u2019s history of carbimazole use makes drug-induced pancreatitis the more likely cause.\r\n\r\nAcute pancreatitis can be caused by medications, including carbimazole, which is commonly used to manage hyperthyroidism. \r\nAccording to BNF and NICE guidelines, carbimazole-induced pancreatitis is a rare but serious adverse reaction. If pancreatitis is suspected, carbimazole should be stopped immediately, and alternative antithyroid therapies (e.g., propylthiouracil) should be considered.\r\n\r\nPatients should be monitored for recovery and advised to avoid re-exposure to carbimazole due to the risk of severe or fatal recurrence. Common causes of pancreatitis, such as gallstones, alcohol use, or hypertriglyceridemia, should also be excluded through a detailed history, imaging, and laboratory investigations.\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "G) Increased risk of cardiodepression\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDiltiazem is a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker (CCB) used to manage angina. When used with beta blockers, there is an increased risk of cardiodepression. Both diltiazem and beta blockers reduce heart rate and myocardial contractility, potentially leading to bradycardia, heart block, or hypotension. According to NICE guidelines, combining these drugs requires careful monitoring to avoid significant cardiodepressive effects.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic: There is no evidence to suggest that diltiazem significantly impacts the absorption of antibiotics.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant: Diltiazem does not typically affect the efficacy of anticoagulants, though drug interactions with anticoagulants can occur, such as with warfarin, but not in this scenario.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive: Diltiazem does not decrease the efficacy of contraceptives. This interaction is more relevant with certain antibiotics or anticonvulsants.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of bleeding: Diltiazem does not increase the risk of bleeding. This risk is generally associated with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia: There is no significant risk of hyperkalaemia with diltiazem unless used in conjunction with specific potassium-sparing diuretics.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: Diltiazem does not typically increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia risks are more relevant with insulin or sulfonylureas.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome is primarily associated with drugs that influence serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), not diltiazem.\r\n\r\nCalcium channel blockers (CCBs) like diltiazem are effective in the management of stable angina, but their use in combination with beta blockers should be carefully considered. Both drug classes have negative chronotropic effects (reduce heart rate) and negative inotropic effects (reduce myocardial contractility), which may result in excessive lowering of heart rate, leading to heart block or hypotension. The NICE guidelines recommend monitoring for signs of bradycardia or other cardiovascular complications when these drugs are used together. In some cases, non-rate-limiting CCBs (like amlodipine) might be preferred over rate-limiting CCBs (like diltiazem) in combination with beta blockers to reduce the risk of cardiodepression.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovscular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin) are alternatives if doxycycline is contraindicated (e.g., pregnancy).\r\n\r\nConservative measures such as nasal saline irrigation or analgesics should also be encouraged. Regular reassessment is essential to monitor symptom resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\n(B) Candesartan\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCandesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), can contribute to acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly in patients who are volume depleted, have pre-existing kidney disease, or are on other nephrotoxic drugs. ARBs reduce glomerular filtration pressure by dilating the efferent arteriole, which can impair kidney function in situations where renal perfusion is already compromised.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Amlodipine\r\n\r\n A calcium channel blocker primarily used for hypertension and angina. It does not typically cause AKI but can lead to hypotension, which in rare cases might contribute to renal hypoperfusion.\r\n\r\n(C) Carbimazole \r\n\r\nUsed for hyperthyroidism, carbimazole is not directly nephrotoxic and is unlikely to contribute to AKI.\r\n\r\n(D) Morphine\r\n\r\nOpioids do not directly cause AKI, though severe hypotension due to opioid-induced vasodilation or dehydration from opioid-induced nausea and vomiting could indirectly affect kidney function.\r\n\r\n(E) Penicillin V\r\n\r\nWhile some antibiotics can contribute to AKI, penicillin V is not typically associated with nephrotoxicity.\r\n\r\nAcute Kidney Injury and ARBs\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, AKI is characterised by a rapid decline in kidney function and is often triggered by factors such as hypovolaemia, nephrotoxic drugs, and conditions that affect renal perfusion. ARBs (e.g. candesartan) and ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients at risk of AKI, and treatment should be reviewed in cases of declining renal function. Management involves withdrawing or adjusting nephrotoxic medications, optimising fluid balance, and monitoring renal function closely to prevent further deterioration.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of myelosuppression\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Methotrexate is primarily excreted renally. Amoxicillin can reduce its renal clearance, leading to accumulation of methotrexate in the body. This raises the risk of methotrexate toxicity, particularly myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), which can present as low white cells, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia.\r\n\r\n- The BNF warns that penicillins (including amoxicillin) can increase methotrexate toxicity, especially myelosuppression.\r\n\r\n- This is a clinically significant interaction, and monitoring of FBC and renal function is advised when both are co-prescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Increased risk of bleeding \u2013 Not a recognised interaction between methotrexate and amoxicillin.\r\n\r\nB) Increased risk of toxicity \u2013 While true generally, this answer is non-specific; E (myelosuppression) is the more precise adverse effect.\r\n\r\nC) Increased risk of nephrotoxicity \u2013 Not a common result of this combination.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of hepatotoxicity \u2013 Methotrexate can be hepatotoxic, but this is not enhanced specifically by amoxicillin.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethotrexate + Amoxicillin may lead to increased methotrexate levels and cause myelosuppression due to reduced renal clearance. Regular FBC monitoring is essential when these drugs are used together.",

She has been injecting insulin into the same spot on her abdomen for the past few months. She notices that the skin around the injection site has become thickened and lumpy.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nB. The skin around the injection site has developed lipodystrophy due to repeated injection of insulin.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF and NICE guidelines, lipodystrophy is a well-known complication of repeated insulin injections in the same site. It can present as lipoatrophy (fat loss) or lipohypertrophy (fat accumulation) and results in thickened, lumpy skin. This alters insulin absorption, leading to poor glycaemic control or unpredictable insulin action.\r\n\r\nKey preventative measures include:\r\n\r\n- Rotating injection sites regularly.\r\n\r\n- Avoiding repeated use of the same anatomical area.\r\n\r\n- Checking for skin changes before each injection.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Infection due to poor hygiene\r\n\r\nWould typically present with redness, warmth, pain, and possibly pus \u2014 not thickened, lumpy skin over time.\r\n\r\nC. Cutaneous amyloidosis\r\n\r\nVery rare. Though it can occur with long-term injections, lipodystrophy is far more common and typical in this scenario.\r\n\r\nD. Allergic reaction to insulin\r\n\r\nWould cause itching, redness, or urticaria shortly after injection, not persistent thickening.\r\n\r\nE. Bruising due to blood vessel damage\r\n\r\nPresents as blue/purple discolouration, not firm, persistent lumps.\r\n\r\nInjection site complications:\r\n\r\n- Lipodystrophy is the most common skin-related complication with insulin therapy.\r\n\r\n- It occurs from injecting repeatedly into the same site.\r\n\r\n- Rotating sites helps prevent it.\r\n\r\n- Lipodystrophic tissue can cause erratic insulin absorption \u2192 important to avoid injecting into affected areas.\r\n\r\n- Healthcare professionals should routinely inspect injection sites during reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 6) The Endocrine system:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Co-amoxiclav is a first-line option, particularly when beta-lactamase-producing organisms are suspected. Monitoring renal function and clinical response throughout treatment is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes while minimising adverse effects.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson chapter 5 (Infection):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "**Which of the following is best course of action?**",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nC. Refer the patient back to the prescriber as they may require a dose reduction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient is experiencing heart palpitations and difficulty sleeping, which are common symptoms of excess thyroid hormone (iatrogenic hyperthyroidism) due to a possible excessive dose of levothyroxine. In such cases:\r\n\r\nThe patient should be referred for thyroid function tests (TFTs) to assess TSH, T3, and T4 levels.\r\nIf the results suggest low TSH and elevated T3/T4, the dose of levothyroxine may need reduction to prevent complications such as atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Reassure the patient that the symptoms described are likely to resolve without intervention\r\n\r\nHyperthyroid symptoms do not resolve on their own if caused by an excessive levothyroxine dose. Untreated, this could lead to cardiovascular complications, including atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nB. Refer the patient back to the prescriber as they may require a dose increase\r\n\r\nIncreasing the dose would worsen the symptoms by further inducing hyperthyroidism.\r\n\r\nD. Refer the patient back to the prescriber to switch the drug to an alternative agent\r\n\r\nLevothyroxine is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism, and there is no need to switch. The issue here is dosage adjustment, not drug choice.\r\n\r\nE. Sell an over-the-counter product and ask them to return if the symptoms have not gone within 1 week\r\n\r\nOTC products are not appropriate for treating symptoms of over-replacement with levothyroxine. The patient requires medical assessment and dose adjustment, not symptomatic treatment.\r\n\r\nF. Sell an over-the-counter product and ask them to return if the symptoms have not gone within 3 weeks\r\n\r\nSame reason as E; OTC treatment is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nG. Submit a Yellow Card report detailing the nature of the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Card Scheme is used for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially new or serious side effects. Palpitations from levothyroxine overdose are a known side effect, so this does not require a Yellow Card report.\r\n\r\nH. Take the patient's blood pressure to help inform your final course of action\r\n\r\nBlood pressure measurement is not a definitive method for diagnosing levothyroxine over-replacement. The priority is to assess thyroid function (TFTs) via the prescriber.\r\n\r\nNext Steps for the Patient:\r\n\r\nRefer the patient to their GP or prescriber for thyroid function tests (TFTs).\r\nAdvise them to monitor symptoms (palpitations, sweating, weight loss, tremors).\r\nIf hyperthyroidism is confirmed, the prescriber will adjust the levothyroxine dose accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

On further questioning they tell you that for the past two weeks they have felt tired, had bloody stools that will not go away.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nB. Gastrointestinal Bleed\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient\u2019s fatigue and persistent bloody stools are indicative of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is a recognised adverse effect of phenytoin. Phenytoin can cause gastritis and GI ulceration, potentially leading to upper GI bleeding. The presence of fatigue suggests possible anaemia due to chronic blood loss.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Anaphylactic Reaction\r\n\r\nAnaphylaxis would present with rash, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and swelling, rather than chronic fatigue and bloody stools. Phenytoin can cause hypersensitivity reactions, but the patient\u2019s symptoms are not consistent with an acute allergic response.\r\n\r\nC. Gingival Hypertrophy\r\n\r\nPhenytoin-induced gingival hypertrophy is a chronic side effect but does not explain bloody stools or fatigue. This typically manifests as gum overgrowth and bleeding gums rather than GI bleeding.\r\n\r\nD. Hepatotoxicity\r\n\r\nPhenytoin-induced liver toxicity may cause jaundice, nausea, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes, but bloody stools are not a primary feature.\r\n\r\nE. Necrotising Enterocolitis\r\n\r\nNecrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is primarily seen in preterm neonates, presenting with abdominal distension, bloody stools, and sepsis. It is not a recognised complication of phenytoin in adults.\r\n\r\nPhenytoin and Gastrointestinal Risks\r\n\r\nPhenytoin is an enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug (AED) used to control seizures. However, it is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, which can increase the risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nMonitoring Recommendations (BNF & NICE Guidelines 2025):\r\n\r\n- Regular monitoring for GI side effects in patients on phenytoin.\r\n- Consider gastroprotection (e.g., PPI or H2 antagonist) if long-term use is required.\r\n- Haematological monitoring for signs of anaemia due to chronic blood loss.\r\n\r\nKey Learning Points:\r\n\r\n- Phenytoin can cause gastrointestinal irritation, leading to ulceration and bleeding.\r\n- Patients on long-term phenytoin should be monitored for GI symptoms.\r\n- Fatigue + bloody stools should prompt urgent investigation for GI bleeding.\r\n- Alternative AEDs should be considered if phenytoin is poorly tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Flecainide\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patient has persistent atrial fibrillation and has been adequately anticoagulated with warfarin for over 3 weeks, with a therapeutic INR of 2.8. She has no structural heart disease or other comorbidities, and is haemodynamically stable, making her a suitable candidate for pharmacological cardioversion.\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF and NICE guidelines, the most appropriate antiarrhythmic agent for pharmacological cardioversion in patients without structural heart disease or left ventricular dysfunction is flecainide.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Digoxin\r\n\r\nDigoxin is used primarily for rate control, not rhythm control. It does not restore sinus rhythm, and is therefore unsuitable for cardioversion.\r\n\r\nB) Diltiazem\r\n\r\nLike digoxin, diltiazem is a rate-controlling agent, particularly in patients with AF who are not candidates for rhythm control. It has no role in pharmacological cardioversion.\r\n\r\nD) Propranolol\r\n\r\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker used for rate control. It does not actively restore sinus rhythm and is therefore not appropriate for pharmacological cardioversion.\r\n\r\nE) Verapamil\r\n\r\nVerapamil is another rate-controlling calcium channel blocker. It is not suitable for rhythm restoration and is not used for cardioversion.\r\n\r\nIn stable patients with persistent AF and no structural heart disease, flecainide is the drug of choice for pharmacological cardioversion. It works quickly to restore sinus rhythm and is safe in patients with preserved cardiac function who are appropriately anticoagulated.",

His CrCL is estimated to be 29mL/min\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for metformin has been provided for you:\r\n[SmPC for metformin](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/13160/smpc)",

    "why": "H. Severe renal impairment\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMetformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min). In such cases, the risk of lactic acidosis, a rare but life-threatening condition, is significantly increased due to reduced clearance of metformin by the kidneys. The patient\u2019s CrCL is 29 mL/min, which falls into the category of severe renal impairment, making the prescription inappropriate.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\r\n\r\nThese conditions are not contraindications for metformin use.\r\n\r\nB. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease\r\n\r\nWhile metformin is generally safe for patients with cardiovascular conditions, caution may be needed in patients with acute or unstable heart failure. However, this is not relevant to the scenario provided.\r\n\r\nC. Concomitant use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets\r\n\r\nNo significant interaction between metformin and anticoagulants/antiplatelets makes this a contraindication.\r\n\r\nD. Diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia\r\n\r\nMetformin is an indicated treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus but not for type 1 diabetes. This scenario involves type 1 diabetes, where metformin is not first-line therapy. However, the contraindication here is due to renal impairment rather than diabetes type.\r\n\r\nE. History of peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding\r\n\r\nMetformin is not contraindicated in patients with a history of peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding, though it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nF. Liver disease or alcoholism\r\n\r\nMetformin is contraindicated in severe liver disease or chronic alcoholism due to the increased risk of lactic acidosis, but this is not relevant in this scenario.\r\n\r\nG. Pregnancy and lactation\r\n\r\nMetformin is not contraindicated during pregnancy but is used with caution and under specialist guidance. It is not the focus of this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetformin and Contraindications\r\n\r\nMetformin is an effective first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes but is contraindicated in specific conditions due to the risk of lactic acidosis. \r\n\r\nThese include:\r\n\r\nSevere renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min)\r\nSevere liver dysfunction or chronic alcoholism\r\nAcute conditions associated with hypoxia (e.g., sepsis, heart failure).\r\nIn this scenario, the patient\u2019s CrCL is below the safety threshold, highlighting the importance of renal function assessment before prescribing metformin. Regular monitoring of renal function is essential during therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "F) Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe differences in the shape, colour, and taste of the sildenafil tablets raise suspicion that the medicine might be counterfeit or defective. According to the NICE guidelines and MHRA Yellow Card Scheme, it is essential to report suspected counterfeit or defective medicines to ensure public health safety. Counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk as they may contain incorrect ingredients, wrong dosages, or harmful substances. Reporting helps regulatory authorities investigate and take corrective action.\r\n\r\nThis case aligns with the criteria for reporting under the Yellow Card Scheme, as it involves a concern about the authenticity or quality of a medicine, especially one purchased outside the regulated supply chain.\r\n\r\nExplanations of other options: \r\n\r\nA) Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction \u2013 This case does not involve an adverse drug reaction.\r\n\r\nB) Report: Black triangle medicine \u2013 Sildenafil is not a black triangle medicine, which applies only to medicines under additional monitoring.\r\n\r\nC) Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction \u2013 There is no adverse reaction described, delayed or otherwise.\r\n\r\nD) Report: Herbal or Homoeopathic medicine \u2013 Sildenafil is not a herbal or homoeopathic product.\r\n\r\nE) Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction \u2013 There is no indication of a serious or life-threatening reaction.\r\n\r\nG) Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine \u2013 The scenario does not suggest abuse or misuse.\r\n\r\nH) Report: Vaccine reaction \u2013 This does not involve a vaccine.\r\n\r\nSuspected counterfeit or defective medicine. Medicines purchased online from unregulated sources are at high risk of being counterfeit. Reporting such suspicions via the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme protects public health by enabling prompt investigation and regulatory action. Pharmacists should also counsel patients on purchasing medicines only from licensed sources.\r\n\r\nFor further details, refer to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 - 16 (MHRA) :\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Manic episodes can lead to aggression, impulsivity, and self-harm, making effective treatment critical.\r\n\r\nLithium is the gold-standard mood stabiliser, with evidence showing its effectiveness in:\r\n\r\n- Reducing manic and depressive relapse\r\n- Lowering aggression and impulsivity\r\n- Preventing suicidal behaviour in bipolar patients\r\n\r\nRegular monitoring of lithium levels is essential, as toxicity can occur if levels exceed the therapeutic range (0.6\u20131.2 mmol/L).\r\n\r\nAlternative mood stabilisers, such as valproate, can be considered when lithium is unsuitable.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Use with caution\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic decongestant that causes vasoconstriction by stimulating \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. This can lead to increased blood pressure and reduced antihypertensive efficacy, particularly in patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disease.\r\n\r\nThe patient is already on ramipril and amlodipine, indicating established hypertension. Therefore, pseudoephedrine should not be used routinely in such patients without considering the potential for blood pressure elevation or cardiovascular strain.\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate advice is: \"Use with caution\".\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Avoid \r\n\r\nNot strictly contraindicated. May be used if absolutely necessary with caution and short-term use. However, alternatives like saline sprays or steam inhalation are often preferred.\r\n\r\nB) Monitor \r\n\r\nWhile blood pressure monitoring is always good practice, this doesn\u2019t address the need for caution before initiating the drug.\r\n\r\nC) No interaction \r\n\r\nIncorrect. There is a well-known interaction with antihypertensives and pseudoephedrine, especially in those with established hypertension.\r\n\r\nD) Reduce dose \r\n\r\nThere's no officially recommended lower dose of pseudoephedrine for hypertensive patients. The concern is more about whether it should be used at all.\r\n\r\nPseudoephedrine Use in Hypertensive Patients:\r\n\r\nPseudoephedrine, though effective as a nasal decongestant, can increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, particularly in patients with uncontrolled or treated hypertension. It may reduce the efficacy of antihypertensive medications like ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.\r\nNICE and BNF recommend cautious use or avoiding systemic decongestants in patients with cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Where possible, suggest non-pharmacological alternatives (e.g. steam inhalation, saline nasal sprays) or topical decongestants for short durations.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He presents to the pharmacy with symptoms of dehydration, such as dry mouth, thirst, and reduced urine output. He says that he has been vomiting several times a day for the past week and has lost his appetite. He denies any other symptoms or changes in his medication.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Advise him to stop taking rivastigmine immediately and seek urgent medical attention.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Rivastigmine, like other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, commonly causes gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite, particularly during dose escalation or when not well tolerated.\r\n\r\n- This patient is elderly and has been vomiting for several days, with dehydration signs like reduced urine output and dry mouth. This can lead to serious complications such as:\r\n\r\n- Acute kidney injury\r\n\r\n- Electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hyponatraemia)\r\n\r\n- Hypotension and hospitalisation\r\n\r\n- Stopping rivastigmine and urgent medical review is needed to prevent further complications and reassess treatment options.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Advise him to reduce his dose of rivastigmine gradually and monitor his plasma-rivastigmine concentration.\r\n\r\nThis is not sufficient in an acute setting. While dose reduction may help with mild GI side effects, ongoing vomiting and dehydration require immediate cessation and medical review. Plasma concentration monitoring is not routinely recommended for rivastigmine.\r\n\r\nC) Advise him to continue taking rivastigmine as prescribed and drink plenty of fluids.\r\n\r\nInappropriate here because he is actively vomiting and unlikely to retain fluids or medication. Continuing the drug may worsen his symptoms and put him at risk of serious dehydration-related complications.\r\n\r\nD) Advise him to switch to another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with fewer side effects.\r\n\r\nNot the right step at this stage. Other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. donepezil, galantamine) have similar GI side effects. First, his current condition needs to be stabilised before considering alternatives.\r\n\r\nE) Advise him to have his serum sodium and potassium levels checked.\r\n\r\nWhile electrolyte checks are important, they are not the immediate action.

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Start Ramipril\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMr W is a 57-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and micro-albuminuria. The presence of micro-albuminuria (early kidney damage) indicates diabetic nephropathy, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD).\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, all patients with diabetes and micro-albuminuria should be started on an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) regardless of blood pressure to provide renal protection. Ramipril (an ACEi) is the first-line choice.\r\n\r\n\u2714 ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria, slow CKD progression, and lower cardiovascular risk in diabetes.\r\n\u2714 Ramipril should be started at a low dose and titrated based on renal function and blood pressure.\r\n\u2714 Monitoring of renal function and potassium is essential after initiation to prevent worsening renal impairment and hyperkalaemia.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Start Clopidogrel \r\n\r\nNICE does not recommend clopidogrel in primary prevention for diabetes unless there is a clear indication (e.g., established cardiovascular disease or aspirin intolerance).\r\nAspirin is already prescribed for primary cardiovascular prevention, which is in line with current guidelines.\r\n\r\n(C) Stop Aspirin \r\n\r\nAspirin is indicated in high-risk patients with diabetes and hypertension, as Mr W likely has multiple cardiovascular risk factors.\r\nNICE still supports aspirin for primary prevention in high-risk patients.\r\n\r\n(D) Stop Atorvastatin \r\n\r\nNICE recommends statin therapy (atorvastatin 20 mg OD) for all diabetics over 40 years old due to their high cardiovascular risk.\r\nStopping atorvastatin would increase cardiovascular risk in Mr W.\r\n\r\n(E) Stop Glibenclamide \r\n\r\nNot the most urgent intervention, but caution is needed.\r\nGlibenclamide is a sulfonylurea with a higher risk of hypoglycaemia in older adults, and NICE generally prefers alternatives (e.g., metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, or DPP-4 inhibitors).\r\nHowever, starting an ACEi (Ramipril) is the priority to protect the kidneys.\r\n\r\nGuidance on Diabetes and Micro-albuminuria\r\n\r\n- All patients with diabetes and micro-albuminuria should be on an ACEi or ARB for renal protection.\r\n\r\n- Blood pressure should be monitored closely when initiating Ramipril to prevent hypotension.\r\n\r\n- Renal function (eGFR and potassium levels) should be checked before starting and within 2 weeks after initiation.\r\n\r\n- Statin therapy (atorvastatin 20 mg OD) should be continued for cardiovascular risk reduction.\r\n\r\n- Aspirin should be continued in high-risk patients with diabetes.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Clarithromycin\r\n\r\nUsed for atypical organisms (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae) or as an alternative in penicillin-allergic patients. It may also be combined with amoxicillin in more severe cases.\r\nIn the question it clearly says no risk factors for resistant organisms!\r\n\r\nC. Doxycycline\r\n\r\nAn alternative for patients who are allergic to penicillin. It is effective against both typical and atypical pathogens but is less preferred as monotherapy in moderate CAP.\r\n\r\nD. Flucloxacillin\r\n\r\nEffective against Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in soft tissue infections. Not suitable for CAP caused by typical respiratory pathogens.\r\n\r\nE. Nitrofurantoin\r\n\r\nSpecific for urinary tract infections and has no role in the treatment of respiratory infections.\r\n\r\nF. Phenoxymethylpenicillin\r\n\r\nLess effective for CAP as it does not provide adequate coverage for Haemophilus influenzae.\r\n\r\nG. Trimethoprim\r\n\r\nPrimarily used for UTIs; not effective against the typical pathogens responsible for CAP.\r\n\r\nH. Vancomycin\r\n\r\nReserved for severe Gram-positive infections, such as MRSA. Not appropriate for first-line CAP management.\r\n\r\nNICE provides the following recommendations for managing CAP:\r\n\r\nCURB-65 Score Interpretation:\r\n\r\n0\u20131: Low severity \u2013 outpatient management with oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin).\r\n2: Moderate severity \u2013 consider hospital admission; start with oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin or dual therapy with amoxicillin and clarithromycin.\r\n\u22653: High severity \u2013 hospital admission with intravenous antibiotics.\r\n\r\nFirst-line Antibiotics:\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin is preferred for typical pathogens.\r\nAlternatives include doxycycline or clarithromycin for penicillin-allergic patients.\r\nDuration of Treatment:\r\n\r\n5 days for most patients, but extend if symptoms persist or severity increases.\r\nEarly diagnosis, risk stratification using CURB-65, and prompt initiation of antibiotics are critical to reducing mortality and preventing complications such as empyema or sepsis.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Chest compressions at a depth of 5\u20136 cm and a rate of 100\u2013120 per minute are vital for maintaining blood flow during cardiac arrest. This method maximises the chances of survival until advanced help arrives.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed information, refer to the Resuscitation Council UK Guidelines.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has no other medical conditions or allergies. She asks for your advice on what antibiotic she should take to treat her infection.",
    "why": "E) Metronidazole\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMetronidazole is the most appropriate antibiotic for this patient because it is an effective alternative for treating a dental abscess in individuals with a history of severe penicillin allergy. It does not cross-react with penicillin, making it a safe choice for patients with anaphylaxis to penicillin or amoxicillin.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Cephalexin\r\n\r\nCephalexin is a cephalosporin and has a risk of cross-reactivity with penicillin. In patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, cephalosporins should be avoided due to the potential for an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\nB) Clindamycin\r\n\r\nClindamycin is effective for dental abscesses, but it is typically used for more complicated cases. It may cause gastrointestinal side effects, and is generally considered second-line therapy compared to metronidazole.\r\n\r\nC) Co-amoxiclav\r\n\r\nCo-amoxiclav contains amoxicillin, which is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin. This makes it unsuitable for this patient.\r\n\r\nD) Erythromycin\r\n\r\nErythromycin is less effective than both clindamycin and metronidazole in treating dental abscesses. It also has a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nThe management of dental abscesses in patients with allergies requires careful antibiotic selection. NICE guidelines emphasize the need to avoid penicillin and amoxicillin in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to these drugs. Metronidazole is a suitable alternative due to its effectiveness and lack of cross-reactivity. Clindamycin may also be used but is typically reserved for more complicated cases. In such situations, antibiotics like co-amoxiclav and cephalosporins should be avoided due to the risk of allergic reactions. Effective treatment involves balancing antibiotic efficacy with patient safety to ensure optimal outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has episodes of palpitations and dizziness that last for a few hours and resolve spontaneously. He has no history of stroke or thromboembolism. He has no known drug allergies.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC. Pill-in-the-pocket approach with flecainide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe pill-in-the-pocket approach is a recognised treatment for selected patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are otherwise low risk. It is used in patients who have infrequent, well-tolerated episodes that terminate spontaneously. Flecainide is a Class Ic antiarrhythmic used in this setting to restore sinus rhythm when taken at the onset of symptoms. This approach avoids the need for continuous daily medication and is effective for symptom relief in suitable patients without structural heart disease or significant risk factors.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Anticoagulation with warfarin\r\n\r\nThis patient has no risk factors for stroke or thromboembolism, and his CHA2DS2-VASc score is zero. Anticoagulation is not indicated in such cases. Warfarin or DOACs would be considered only if the stroke risk was higher.\r\n\r\nB. Catheter ablation\r\n\r\nThis is generally reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms despite medication or in whom rhythm control is preferred but medications are not effective or suitable. It would not be first-line for someone with infrequent, self-limiting episodes.\r\n\r\nD. Rate control with beta-blockers\r\n\r\nRate control is more appropriate for patients with persistent or permanent AF, or where rhythm control is not suitable. This patient has paroxysmal AF with short, self-limiting episodes, so rhythm control is preferred in this case.\r\n\r\nE. Rhythm control with amiodarone\r\n\r\nAmiodarone is typically used in patients with structural heart disease or where other rhythm control options are unsuitable. It carries a significant long-term side effect profile, including thyroid, liver, and lung toxicity, and would not be first choice in a young, otherwise healthy patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nParoxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients without structural heart disease and with low stroke risk can be managed using a pill-in-the-pocket approach. Flecainide or propafenone can be taken at symptom onset to terminate episodes. This strategy helps avoid daily medication and is appropriate for patients with infrequent, self-terminating symptoms and no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction or conduction abnormalities.",

    "why": "A) Decreased absorption of antibiotic\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCalcium carbonate interacts with doxycycline by forming insoluble chelates, which significantly reduce the absorption of doxycycline in the gastrointestinal tract. This interaction decreases doxycycline\u2019s efficacy in treating the chest infection. To minimise this effect, it is recommended that doxycycline be taken at least 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after calcium-containing products.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant: Calcium carbonate does not interact with anticoagulants.\r\n\r\nC) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive: Doxycycline does not significantly reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives, although alternative methods are sometimes advised when taking antibiotics.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of bleeding: Neither doxycycline nor calcium carbonate increases bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia: Calcium carbonate and doxycycline do not pose a significant risk of hyperkalaemia.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: There is no evidence that doxycycline or calcium carbonate increases the risk of hypoglycaemia.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension: This interaction is not associated with doxycycline or calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome is linked to serotonergic agents, not doxycycline or calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines emphasise the importance of recognising interactions that can impair antibiotic efficacy. For doxycycline, chelation with calcium, iron, or magnesium-containing products is a known issue. To optimise absorption, patients should be advised to space out the administration of doxycycline and calcium-containing medications or supplements. This is particularly critical for young, otherwise healthy patients to ensure the infection is treated effectively without unnecessary treatment delays.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 84- year- old man has been admitted to hospital. They have been on apixaban 5 mg BD.\r\nThe patient weighs 75 kg and has a eGFR of 24 mL/min. The patient is on apixaban for prevention of stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Summary of Product Characteristic for apixiban has been provided for you.\u00a0\r\n\r\n[SmPC for Eliquis 5 mg](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/2878/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Reduce the dose of apixaban to 2.5 mg twice daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines and the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Apixaban, the standard dose of apixaban for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is 5 mg twice daily. However, a dose reduction to 2.5 mg twice daily is required if the patient meets at least two of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- Age 80 years or older\r\n- Body weight of 60 kg or less\r\n- Serum creatinine \u2265133 micromol/L\r\n\r\nThis patient is 84 years old and has an eGFR of 24 mL/min, which strongly suggests renal impairment. Although the weight is 75 kg and does not meet the threshold for dose reduction, the patient still meets two of the three dose reduction criteria, making 2.5 mg twice daily the correct and safest dose.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Continue with current dose of apixaban cautiously\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because the patient meets the dose reduction criteria outlined in the SmPC. Continuing apixaban 5 mg BD in this case increases the risk of bleeding, particularly given the patient\u2019s renal impairment (eGFR 24 mL/min).\r\n\r\nC) Start the apixaban initial dose again at 10 mg BD for 7 days\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because the 10 mg BD regimen is used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), not for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. This dose is not appropriate in a patient with atrial fibrillation and renal impairment.\r\n\r\nD) Stop apixaban and switch to warfarin for anticoagulant cover\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because apixaban is still suitable in patients with eGFR >15 mL/min. Warfarin would only be preferred if eGFR <15 mL/min or if the patient had another contraindication to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Switching to warfarin is unnecessary and exposes the patient to the need for frequent INR monitoring and a higher bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nE) Stop apixaban without any further anticoagulant cover\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect as the patient is on apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Stopping anticoagulation without an alternative would significantly increase the risk of stroke in a high-risk patient.\r\n\r\nApixaban Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment:\r\n\r\nApixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that is widely used for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The standard dose is 5 mg twice daily, but dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment, low body weight, or advanced age to minimise the risk of major bleeding.\r\n\r\nIn patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15\u201329 mL/min), apixaban can still be used at a reduced dose (2.5 mg BD), but careful monitoring is essential. However, if eGFR falls below 15 mL/min, apixaban should be avoided, and warfarin may be considered.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, patients with renal impairment on DOACs should have regular renal function monitoring to ensure safe anticoagulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He complains of swelling in his ankles and shortness of breath. His blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg and his serum creatinine level is 180 micromol/L.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Losartan and indometacin interaction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nLosartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that lowers blood pressure and protects kidney function. Indometacin is a potent NSAID that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. When combined, ARBs and NSAIDs can reduce glomerular filtration, blunt the antihypertensive effects of ARBs, and increase the risk of renal impairment, fluid retention, and oedema. The patient\u2019s raised creatinine, persistent hypertension, and ankle swelling are classic signs of this interaction. BNF warns against this combination, especially in patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Indometacin-induced fluid retention\r\n\r\nNSAIDs alone can cause fluid retention, but this does not explain the raised creatinine and uncontrolled BP, the interaction with losartan is more likely.\r\n\r\nB) Hypertension-induced heart failure\r\n\r\nHypertension can lead to heart failure long-term, but the acute rise in creatinine and new-onset oedema point toward a drug interaction.\r\n\r\nD) Losartan-induced renal impairment\r\n\r\nLosartan alone is usually nephroprotective, not nephrotoxic. Impairment is more likely due to co-prescribed NSAIDs.\r\n\r\nE) Rheumatoid arthritis-induced inflammation\r\n\r\nRA can cause systemic effects, but swelling and shortness of breath with a creatinine rise are not classic symptoms of RA flare.\r\n\r\n\r\n- This is a classic case of an ARB\u2013NSAID interaction, leading to fluid retention, uncontrolled hypertension, and renal impairment.

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC. Doxycycline\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDoxycycline is the only tetracycline antibiotic that may be taken with food or milk if gastric irritation occurs, unlike other tetracyclines which are significantly affected by calcium containing products. \r\nAccording to the BNF, although food may slightly reduce the absorption of doxycycline, this reduction is not clinically significant. Therefore, it may be taken with milk or meals for better tolerability. \r\nPatients should be advised to take it with plenty of water while sitting or standing upright and to avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after administration to prevent oesophageal irritation.\r\n\r\nExplanation Of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Ciprofloxacin \r\n\r\nNot a tetracycline; it\u2019s a fluoroquinolone. Milk impairs its absorption due to chelation with calcium.\r\n\r\nB.

    "text": "A 28-year-old pregnant woman has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Her blood glucose levels remain elevated despite following a diet and being physically active.",
    "why": "Metformin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMetformin is the most suitable oral medication for the treatment of gestational diabetes when blood glucose levels cannot be adequately controlled with diet and physical activity alone. Metformin works by reducing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity, making it effective for lowering blood glucose levels during pregnancy. It is considered safe for use in pregnancy, with no significant adverse effects on the fetus or mother.\r\n\r\nWhile insulin is generally the first-line pharmacological treatment for gestational diabetes, metformin is often used as an alternative or in combination with insulin, especially if the patient prefers oral treatment or if insulin therapy is not feasible.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Canagliflozin\r\n\r\nCanagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. SGLT2 inhibitors are not recommended in pregnancy due to insufficient safety data and potential risks to the developing fetus.\r\n\r\nB: Dapagliflozin\r\n\r\nLike canagliflozin, dapagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor and is contraindicated during pregnancy due to concerns about fetal safety.\r\n\r\nC: Glimepiride\r\n\r\nGlimepiride is a sulfonylurea, which increases insulin secretion. Sulfonylureas are not recommended in pregnancy as they cross the placenta and may cause neonatal hypoglycaemia.\r\n\r\nE: Pioglitazone\r\n\r\nPioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus and its delayed onset of action, which makes it unsuitable for managing gestational diabetes.\r\n\r\nGestational diabetes is a condition characterised by hyperglycaemia during pregnancy that usually resolves after delivery. According to NICE NG3, the first-line management of gestational diabetes involves dietary changes, physical activity, and blood glucose monitoring. If these measures are insufficient to achieve target glucose levels, insulin is typically recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment. However, metformin may be used as an alternative or in combination with insulin, as it is effective, safe, and well-tolerated during pregnancy. Oral agents like SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones are contraindicated or not recommended due to concerns about fetal safety. Regular follow-up and postnatal glucose testing are essential to monitor maternal health and assess the risk of type 2 diabetes.\r\n\r\nFor information please watch BNF lesson chapter 6 (The Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Prescribe another antiemetic\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDomperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist commonly used for nausea and vomiting, but it is contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to its risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. The MHRA issued a safety warning that domperidone should not be prescribed to patients with underlying cardiac conditions, including heart failure, prolonged QT interval, or significant electrolyte disturbances.\r\n\r\nSince this patient has Parkinson\u2019s disease, nausea and vomiting are likely due to dopaminergic medications (e.g., levodopa, dopamine agonists). Instead of domperidone, a safer antiemetic that does not worsen Parkinson\u2019s symptoms or pose a cardiac risk should be chosen, such as:\r\n\r\nOndansetron (5-HT3 antagonist)\r\nCyclizine (histamine H1 antagonist)\r\nThese options avoid exacerbating both Parkinson\u2019s disease and cardiac risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Increase her Parkinson\u2019s medication\r\n\r\nIncreasing dopaminergic therapy could worsen nausea and is not an appropriate intervention in this scenario.\r\n\r\nC: Prescribe domperidone\r\n\r\nIncorrect due to the MHRA warning against its use in heart failure patients. Domperidone increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\r\n\r\nD: Recommend lifestyle modifications\r\n\r\nWhile dietary adjustments and hydration may help mild nausea, they are insufficient for drug-induced nausea from Parkinson\u2019s medication.\r\n\r\nE: Refer to a neurologist for further evaluation\r\n\r\nNeurology referral may be beneficial in refractory cases, but the immediate step should be prescribing a safer antiemetic.\r\n\r\nParkinson\u2019s disease and its treatment with dopaminergic medications often lead to nausea and vomiting. According to NICE NG71 and BNF Chapter 4: Central Nervous System, domperidone is commonly used for drug-induced nausea in Parkinson\u2019s but is contraindicated in patients with heart failure due to MHRA safety concerns regarding QT prolongation and sudden cardiac death. Alternative antiemetics such as ondansetron or cyclizine should be considered.

It has a better cardiac safety profile compared to other antidepressants and is effective in treating depression.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Amitriptyline \r\n\r\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are not recommended in patients with cardiovascular disease as they can prolong QT interval, increase heart rate, and increase the risk of arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nB) Carbamazepine \r\n\r\nNot used for depression, primarily used for epilepsy and bipolar disorder (particularly for rapid-cycling bipolar disorder).\r\n\r\nC) Citalopram \r\n\r\nAlthough an SSRI, it has dose-dependent QT interval prolongation, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in unstable angina patients.\r\n\r\nD) Lithium \r\n\r\nUsed for bipolar disorder and as an adjunct in treatment-resistant depression, but it is not a first-line treatment for unipolar depression.\r\n\r\nE) Mirtazapine \r\n\r\nCan be considered in patients with poor appetite and insomnia, but its cardiac safety profile is less established than sertraline, so it is not the first choice in patients with unstable angina.\r\n\r\nF) Phenytoin \r\n\r\nNot used for depression, primarily used for epilepsy and seizure control.\r\n\r\n\r\n(H) Venlafaxine \r\n\r\nIncreases blood pressure and is associated with cardiac side effects, making it unsuitable for patients with heart disease.\r\n\r\nDepression in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease\r\n\r\nDepression is highly prevalent in individuals with heart disease and is associated with worse health outcomes, including higher rates of hospitalisation and increased mortality. Patients with conditions such as unstable angina and previous myocardial infarction are particularly vulnerable to depressive symptoms due to the impact of their illness on daily life.\r\n\r\nEffective treatment of depression in these patients not only improves mental health and quality of life but also contributes to better cardiovascular outcomes. Among antidepressants, SSRIs are considered the safest choice for patients with heart disease, with sertraline being the preferred option due to its minimal effects on cardiac conduction.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to avoid antidepressants that increase arrhythmia risk or elevate blood pressure, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and venlafaxine. Even with SSRIs, patients should be monitored regularly, especially for drug interactions and side effects, ensuring both their mental and cardiac health are optimally managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Improve adherence\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe most likely reason for switching from oral risperidone to a depot (long-acting) injection is to improve adherence to treatment. This is especially important for patients who:\r\n\r\n- Frequently miss doses\r\n\r\n- Have poor insight into their illness (e.g. schizophrenia)\r\n\r\n- Have previously relapsed due to non-compliance\r\n\r\n- Depot antipsychotics ensure that medication is administered under supervision, maintaining steady plasma levels and reducing relapse risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Improve efficacy\r\n\r\nDepot risperidone does not increase efficacy compared to the oral form. Both are equally effective when taken as prescribed.\r\n\r\nC) Provide a more rapid response\r\n\r\nDepot risperidone has a delayed onset and often requires a supplementary oral dose for the first 3 weeks. Oral formulations actually act more quickly.\r\n\r\nD) Reduce the risk of extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS)\r\n\r\nThe risk of EPS is similar between oral and depot forms. It depends on dose and individual sensitivity, not the formulation.\r\n\r\nE) Reduce the risk of hyperprolactinaemia\r\n\r\nRisperidone (both oral and depot) is associated with elevated prolactin levels. Switching to depot does not reduce this risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepot risperidone is usually prescribed to ensure consistent dosing in patients who may not reliably take oral medication, thus improving adherence. It is not selected for faster action, better efficacy, or fewer side effects.",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nF) Hypokalaemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIndapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic, which works by promoting sodium and water loss in the distal tubules of the nephron. However, this also enhances potassium excretion, making hypokalaemia a well-known and potentially serious adverse effect.\r\n\r\nWhen used with NSAIDs like ibuprofen, the risk of electrolyte imbalance and renal impairment may increase further due to reduced renal perfusion. NSAIDs can blunt the diuretic effect and increase the risk of acute kidney injury, especially in patients with underlying volume depletion.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Cough\r\n\r\nSeen with ACE inhibitors (e.g. ramipril), not with diuretics.\r\n\r\nB) Bradycardia \r\n\r\nAssociated with beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil).\r\n\r\nC) Dry mouth \r\n\r\nNot a recognised effect of indapamide.\r\n\r\nD) Headache \r\n\r\nNon-specific and not the most characteristic adverse effect here.\r\n\r\nE) Hyperkalaemia \r\n\r\nMore common with potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs.\r\n\r\nG) Peripheral oedema \r\n\r\nLinked more to calcium channel blockers like amlodipine.\r\n\r\nH) Postural hypotension \r\n\r\nMore associated with alpha-blockers (e.g. doxazosin).\r\n\r\n\r\nIndapamide commonly causes hypokalaemia, especially when combined with NSAIDs like ibuprofen.

They inform you they have experienced hallucinations since starting treatment.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for Zyban has been provided for this question [SmPC for Zyban](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3827/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "E. >1/10,000, <1/1,000\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nHallucinations associated with Zyban (bupropion) are considered rare side effects, occurring at a frequency of greater than 1 in 10,000 but less than 1 in 1,000 patients, according to the SmPC for Zyban. This rarity reflects that while hallucinations can occur, they are not common or expected in the majority of patients.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. >1/10: This frequency category is for very common side effects, which occur in more than 10% of patients. Hallucinations do not fall into this category for Zyban.\r\n\r\nB. >1/100, <1/10: This is the category for common side effects, affecting 1-10% of users.

Hallucinations occur less frequently than this in patients taking Zyban.\r\n\r\nD. <1/10,000: This category is for extremely rare side effects, occurring in fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients. Hallucinations occur with a higher frequency than this and thus are not classified here.\r\n\r\nZyban (bupropion) is used to aid smoking cessation, particularly when nicotine replacement therapy is unsuitable or ineffective. It is second-line treatment, with a careful assessment required for patients with a history of psychiatric conditions, as side effects like hallucinations, depression, and anxiety may occur. These neuropsychiatric effects are rare but should be closely monitored. The NICE guidelines recommend that patients should be informed about the risks and be monitored for any adverse mental health effects during treatment. If hallucinations or other serious symptoms occur, treatment should be reconsidered and potentially discontinued.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (central nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nA) Avoid\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient is elderly (89 years old) and taking ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) and furosemide (a loop diuretic), which puts him at increased risk of renal impairment. Adding ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), introduces the well-known \"triple whammy\" effect:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd3a ACE inhibitor + Diuretic + NSAID\r\n\r\n\u2192 Significantly increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI)\r\n\u2192 Can also increase potassium levels, leading to hyperkalaemia\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE and the BNF, NSAIDs should be avoided in elderly patients who are on combinations of antihypertensives and diuretics, especially if they have any degree of renal compromise or fall risk \u2014 both likely in this scenario.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Monitor \r\n\r\nWhile monitoring is always important, ibuprofen should not be initiated at all here due to the high risk of renal injury.\r\n\r\nC) No interaction \r\n\r\nThere is a clear and significant interaction between NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and diuretics.\r\n\r\nD) Reduce dose \r\n\r\nReducing the dose does not eliminate the risk of AKI or hyperkalaemia in this context.\r\n\r\nE) Use with caution \r\n\r\nToo vague for this high-risk situation. NICE and BNF both recommend avoiding NSAIDs in elderly patients with this combination of medications.\r\n\r\nNSAIDs and Renal Risk in the Elderly:\r\n\r\nNSAIDs like ibuprofen are widely used for pain relief, particularly in conditions like osteoarthritis. However, in elderly patients, especially those taking ACE inhibitors and diuretics, NSAIDs can severely reduce renal perfusion, leading to acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances. This interaction, commonly referred to as the \u201ctriple whammy\u201d, is well documented and is a key red flag in medicines optimisation reviews for older patients. In such cases, paracetamol remains the safer first-line option, and if further analgesia is needed, other strategies (e.g., topical NSAIDs or opioids with caution) may be explored.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Nitrofurantoin remains effective and safe with the reported renal function.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amoxicillin\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin is less effective against E. coli due to widespread resistance, especially for uncomplicated UTIs.\r\n\r\nB.

Report: Serious or life-threatening reaction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nJaundice is a serious adverse reaction that could indicate a significant liver issue, such as drug-induced liver injury, which could be life-threatening. According to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme, any serious or life-threatening adverse reactions must be reported to ensure patient safety and improve drug monitoring. In this case, jaundice is not a known, common side effect of dapagliflozin, which increases the urgency of reporting it as a serious adverse reaction.\r\n\r\nIncorrect Options:\r\n\r\nA. Do not report: Known adverse drug reaction: Jaundice is not a typical or well-established adverse reaction of dapagliflozin, so it must be reported.\r\n\r\nB. Report: Black triangle medicine: Dapagliflozin is not classified as a black triangle medicine (new medicines under intensive monitoring), though serious adverse reactions should still be reported for any medication.\r\n\r\nC. Report: Delayed adverse drug reaction: Jaundice in this scenario does not suggest a delayed reaction but rather an acute drug-induced response.\r\n\r\nD. Report: Herbal or Homoeopathic medicine: Dapagliflozin is not an herbal or homeopathic medicine, so this option is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nF. Report: Suspected counterfeit or defective medicine: There is no evidence suggesting the medicine is counterfeit or defective in this case.\r\n\r\nG. Report: Suspected abuse or misuse of a medicine: The scenario does not describe any misuse or abuse of the medication.\r\n\r\nH.

CHA2DS2-VASc score\r\n\r\nTo assess the patient's risk of embolic stroke, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nCHA2DS2-VASc scoring is specifically designed for patients with atrial fibrillation to evaluate their risk of stroke and determine the need for anticoagulation therapy.\r\n\r\nC: Congestive heart failure (1 point)\r\n\r\nH: Hypertension (1 point)\r\n\r\nA: Age \u226575 years (2 points)\r\n\r\nD: Diabetes mellitus (1 point)\r\n\r\nS2: Prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (2 points)\r\n\r\nV: Vascular disease (1 point)\r\n\r\nA: Age 65-74 years (1 point)\r\n\r\nSc: Sex category (female) (1 point)\r\n\r\nStep 1: The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperthyroidism, which increases her risk for embolic stroke.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc score will give an appropriate indication of her stroke risk and guide treatment decisions, particularly around anticoagulation therapy.\r\n\r\nRationale for other options:\r\n\r\nA. Carotid Doppler ultrasound: This is typically used to assess carotid artery disease or stenosis and is not specific for evaluating stroke risk in atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nC. HAS-BLED score: The HAS-BLED score is used to assess the risk of bleeding in patients on anticoagulation therapy, not to assess stroke risk in atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nD. Transthoracic echocardiogram: This can be used to assess heart structure and function, but it doesn't directly assess stroke risk from atrial fibrillation.\r\n\r\nE. Transoesophageal echocardiogram: This is useful in identifying thrombus in the atria, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not primarily used for stroke risk assessment.\r\n\r\nClinical consideration:\r\n\r\nThe CHA2DS2-VASc score is the standard tool recommended by NICE guidelines for assessing the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. A higher score indicates a greater risk, which may prompt the initiation of anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. This score takes into account several clinical factors such as age, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nPeripheral oedema\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient is taking both amlodipine and bisoprolol, but among the side effects listed, peripheral oedema is the most characteristic, and it is strongly associated with amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker.\r\n\r\nAmlodipine causes vasodilation, which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure and can lead to fluid leakage into peripheral tissues, most commonly seen as ankle swelling or oedema.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n- Cough: Associated with ACE inhibitors (e.g. ramipril), not with amlodipine or bisoprolol.\r\n\r\n- Bradycardia: Common with bisoprolol, but less distinctive than peripheral oedema in this context.\r\n\r\n- Dry mouth: Typically linked to anticholinergic drugs, not antihypertensives.\r\n\r\n- Headache: Can occur with amlodipine due to vasodilation, but not as defining as oedema.\r\n\r\n- Hyperkalaemia: May occur with ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics, not commonly with bisoprolol or amlodipine.\r\n\r\n- Hypokalaemia: Linked to loop/thiazide diuretics, not relevant here.\r\n\r\n- Postural hypotension: Can occur with bisoprolol, but again, not as frequent or specific as amlodipine\u2019s peripheral oedema.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, both amlodipine and bisoprolol are appropriate in hypertension and angina. This question includes both drugs, but the answer reflects the most notable adverse effect from either medication. In this case, peripheral oedema from amlodipine is more defining than bradycardia or hypotension from bisoprolol.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen multiple medicines are listed in a question, always consider all of them, and pick the side effect that is most characteristic or likely among the given options.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascula System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He has had these symptoms for the past week and has been taking canagliflozin for the past 2 months.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for canaglifozin has been provided for this question.  [SmPC for Canagliflozin](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8855/smpc)",
    "why": "B. Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nGenital infections, such as balanitis or balanoposthitis, are classified as common side effects of Canagliflozin (\u22651/100 to <1/10). These occur due to the drug\u2019s mechanism of action, which increases glucose excretion through urine (glycosuria). The warm and moist environment promotes fungal growth, making patients susceptible to infections. Male patients on Canagliflozin should be advised to monitor for symptoms such as redness, itching, or soreness of the genital area. Treatment typically involves antifungal agents, such as clotrimazole cream, and maintaining good hygiene.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Very common (\u22651/10):\r\n\r\nUrinary tract infections are more frequent and fall under the very common category for Canagliflozin. However, balanitis or balanoposthitis is less frequent and categorised as common.\r\n\r\nC. Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100):\r\n\r\nElectrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalaemia, are uncommon side effects of Canagliflozin, whereas genital infections are more frequent.\r\n\r\nD. Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000):\r\n\r\nSevere complications, such as Fournier's gangrene (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum), are rare adverse effects of Canagliflozin.\r\n\r\nE. Very rare (<1/10,000):\r\n\r\nAdverse reactions such as severe allergic responses are very rare, while genital infections are far more common.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, patients prescribed Canagliflozin should be informed of the risk of genital and urinary tract infections. Preventative advice includes maintaining personal hygiene, staying hydrated, and recognising early symptoms of infections. For balanitis or balanoposthitis, treatment involves antifungal therapy, and severe or recurrent cases may necessitate a review of the patient\u2019s medication regimen. If left untreated, genital infections can lead to complications, such as cellulitis or secondary infections, highlighting the importance of timely intervention.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "B: 130/80 mmHg\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or higher, the recommended blood pressure target is 130/80 mmHg or lower, particularly if there is proteinuria (albumin:creatinine ratio \u226570 mg/mmol). Lowering blood pressure to this level helps to reduce the progression of kidney disease and the risk of cardiovascular events.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 120/80 mmHg\r\n\r\nThis target is generally too aggressive for most patients and may increase the risk of hypotension-related complications, such as reduced renal perfusion and falls, particularly in those with CKD.\r\n\r\nC: 140/90 mmHg\r\n\r\nThis is the general target for patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetes without CKD or proteinuria. However, in patients with CKD and significant albuminuria, a lower target of 130/80 mmHg is recommended.\r\n\r\nD: 150/90 mmHg\r\n\r\nThis is the threshold for initiating antihypertensive treatment in older adults aged \u226580 years. It is not appropriate for a younger patient with diabetes and CKD.\r\n\r\nE: No specific target\r\n\r\nPatients with diabetes, CKD, and hypertension require carefully defined blood pressure targets to prevent the progression of kidney damage and cardiovascular complications. No specific target would be contrary to current guidelines.\r\n\r\nBlood Pressure Management in Patients with Diabetes and CKD\r\n\r\nTarget blood pressure: NICE recommends 130/80 mmHg for patients with CKD stage 3 or higher with proteinuria.\r\nProteinuria significance: Albumin:creatinine ratio \u226570 mg/mmol indicates the need for stricter control.\r\n\r\nManagement approach:\r\n\r\nUse renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (e.g., ACE inhibitors or ARBs) as first-line treatment for hypertension in CKD.\r\nMonitor renal function and potassium levels regularly to avoid complications like hyperkalaemia.\r\nGoals: Prevent progression to end-stage kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\r\nThis case highlights the need for tailored blood pressure targets in patients with comorbidities to optimise long-term outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with a sudden onset of left-sided weakness and aphasia. She was last seen well 3 hours ago. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, for which she takes warfarin and amlodipine. Her blood pressure is 180/100 mmHg, pulse is irregular at 110 beats per minute, and INR is 2.5. A CT scan shows no evidence of intracranial haemorrhage.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC. Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAlteplase is a thrombolytic (tissue plasminogen activator) used to treat acute ischaemic stroke. \r\nAccording to the BNF and NICE guidelines, it can be used if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and there is no evidence of intracranial bleeding. Imaging such as CT or MRI must be used to exclude haemorrhagic stroke before administering alteplase.\r\n\r\nThis patient meets the criteria because she presented within 3 hours and has no signs of haemorrhage on CT. Although she is on warfarin, her INR is 2.5, which is just within the accepted range for cautious consideration of alteplase use. However, some guidelines recommend caution if INR >1.7, so this case would require further multidisciplinary assessment, but timing remains essential.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Within 1 hour of symptom onset\r\n\r\nThis is too restrictive. Although earlier administration is preferred, the licensed window for alteplase is up to 4.5 hours. Waiting less than 1 hour would unnecessarily exclude many eligible patients.\r\n\r\nB. Within 3 hours of symptom onset\r\n\r\nThis was the original time frame in earlier guidance, but current NICE and BNF recommendations support treatment up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset if criteria are met.\r\n\r\nD. Within 6 hours of symptom onset\r\n\r\nThis is outside the recommended window for intravenous alteplase. Mechanical thrombectomy, not alteplase, may be considered up to 6 hours or longer in some patients.\r\n\r\nE. Within 24 hours of symptom onset\r\n\r\nThis is far beyond the window for alteplase. After 4.5 hours, the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit of thrombolysis. Beyond this point, secondary prevention and supportive care become the focus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlteplase must be given as early as possible, ideally within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and only after confirming no intracranial bleeding on imaging. Time of onset should be clearly established, and patients on anticoagulants require special assessment before use. Stroke is a time critical emergency, and alteplase use is governed by strict protocols to balance benefit and risk.",

It works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the ascending loop of Henle, which enhances diuresis and reduces fluid retention.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the patient has chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and recurrent pulmonary oedema requiring hospitalisation. For HFpEF, the mainstay of management is symptom control, particularly for fluid retention and congestion. Furosemide is the most effective option for promptly addressing these issues and preventing further hospitalisations.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Bisoprolol\r\n\r\nThe patient is already on a beta-blocker. Adding or increasing a beta-blocker would not target fluid retention or pulmonary oedema.\r\n\r\nB. Digoxin\r\n\r\nDigoxin is primarily used for rate control in atrial fibrillation or as an adjunct in symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It does not alleviate pulmonary oedema in HFpEF.\r\n\r\nD. Hydralazine\r\n\r\nHydralazine is used in combination with nitrates for patients with HFrEF who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors or ARBs. It does not address fluid retention in HFpEF.\r\n\r\nE. Isosorbide dinitrate\r\n\r\nThis drug can reduce preload but is not the primary treatment for pulmonary oedema in HFpEF.\r\n\r\nF. Ivabradine\r\n\r\nIvabradine is indicated for heart rate control in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm and elevated heart rates despite beta-blocker therapy.

She says that she has been taking ibuprofen 400 mg twice a day for the past week, which she bought over the counter, without consulting her GP or anticoagulant clinic. Her pharmacist advises her to stop taking ibuprofen immediately and orders a blood test to check her INR.",
    "why": "A: Ibuprofen will increase the risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIbuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, impairing platelet aggregation and increasing the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. When combined with warfarin, which reduces clotting by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the risk of bleeding is significantly heightened. The additive effects on haemostasis make this combination particularly hazardous.\r\n\r\nIbuprofen disrupts platelet function and damages the GI mucosa, leading to a higher risk of bleeding.\r\nWarfarin further compounds this risk by prolonging clotting times (as evidenced by an increased INR).\r\nPatients on warfarin should avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen, and alternative pain management options, such as paracetamol, should be considered instead.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Ibuprofen will reduce the risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ibuprofen increases bleeding risk due to its effects on platelet function and the GI tract.\r\n\r\nC: Ibuprofen will have no effect on the risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ibuprofen has a well-documented interaction with warfarin that increases bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nD: Ibuprofen will increase the risk of thrombosis\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ibuprofen does not increase thrombosis risk; instead, it impairs platelet aggregation, which increases bleeding risk.\r\n\r\nE: Ibuprofen will reduce the risk of thrombosis\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. While ibuprofen inhibits platelet aggregation, this effect does not reduce the risk of thrombosis in a clinically significant way when taken at standard doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarfarin and NSAID Interaction:\r\n\r\nWarfarin increases INR, prolonging clotting time.\r\nNSAIDs like ibuprofen impair platelet aggregation and disrupt GI mucosa.\r\nCombined use increases the risk of bleeding, particularly GI bleeding.\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\n\r\nAvoid NSAIDs in patients on warfarin.\r\nUse paracetamol or other safer alternatives for pain management.\r\nMonitor INR closely if NSAID use is unavoidable, and counsel patients on bleeding signs (e.g., black stools, easy bruising).\r\n\r\nAlternative Pain Relief:\r\n\r\nParacetamol (preferred, with monitoring for liver toxicity at high doses).\r\nTopical NSAIDs for localised pain may be safer options.\r\nThis case highlights the importance of patient education and careful medication review in preventing adverse drug interactions.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Fluoxetine\r\nInhibits CYP2C9 and may potentiate warfarin\u2019s anticoagulant effect, increasing INR. However, this option does not relate to juice consumption.\r\n\r\nG. Grapefruit juice\r\nA potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 but does not significantly affect CYP2C9, which metabolises warfarin. Grapefruit juice interactions are not the cause of increased INR with warfarin.\r\n\r\nDrug Interactions with Warfarin\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, warfarin metabolism is primarily affected by CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. Dietary factors like certain juices (e.g., pomegranate juice) or foods rich in vitamin K can alter INR. Clinical monitoring and patient counselling are essential to prevent adverse outcomes like bleeding or clotting. Regular INR checks and patient education on avoiding interacting substances, including specific juices, are critical in managing patients on warfarin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 60-year-old woman has been diagnosed with hypertension. She also has stable angina and previous myocardial infarction",
    "why": "C: 140/90 mmHg\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe NICE guidelines recommend a blood pressure target of 140/90 mmHg for patients with hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), including those with stable angina or a history of myocardial infarction. Achieving this target reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and further myocardial infarctions, while balancing the risk of side effects from overly aggressive blood pressure lowering.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 120/80 mmHg:\r\n\r\nThis target is too low for most patients with CHD. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure can increase the risk of hypotension and related complications, such as falls or decreased perfusion to vital organs.\r\n\r\nB: 130/80 mmHg:\r\n\r\nAlthough closer to the correct target, this level is primarily recommended for patients with specific conditions such as diabetes with end-organ damage, according to NICE. It is not the standard target for patients with CHD.\r\n\r\nD: 150/90 mmHg:\r\n\r\nThis is the threshold for initiating antihypertensive treatment in older adults (aged \u226580 years) without additional risk factors. For patients with CHD, a tighter control of 140/90 mmHg is preferred.\r\n\r\nE: No specific target:\r\n\r\nBlood pressure targets are essential in managing hypertension to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, particularly in patients with CHD. Not setting a target would be inappropriate and against NICE guidelines.\r\n\r\nBlood Pressure Management in Hypertension with CHD\r\n\r\nTarget blood pressure: NICE recommends 140/90 mmHg for patients with CHD (e.g., angina, previous myocardial infarction).\r\nRationale: This target strikes a balance between reducing cardiovascular risk and avoiding the harms of excessive blood pressure lowering.\r\nIndividualisation: Targets may differ for certain populations, such as those with diabetes or older adults.\r\nRegular monitoring and adjustment of treatment are essential to maintain optimal blood pressure control and prevent complications.\r\nThis case highlights the importance of evidence-based blood pressure targets tailored to individual risk profiles for reducing long-term cardiovascular risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "C) Decreased efficacy of contraceptive\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nRifampicin is a potent enzyme inducer that significantly increases the metabolism of oestrogen and progestogen, the active components of combined oral contraceptives such as Rigevidon. This reduces the contraceptive efficacy, increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy. Patients on rifampicin are advised to use alternative, non-hormonal methods of contraception, such as condoms, or to consider higher-dose hormonal contraception if clinically appropriate.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Decreased absorption of antibiotic: Rifampicin does not have its absorption reduced by oral contraceptives.\r\n\r\nB) Decreased efficacy of anticoagulant: Rifampicin can reduce anticoagulant efficacy, but this interaction is not relevant here.\r\n\r\nD) Increased risk of bleeding: Rifampicin does not increase the risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nE) Increased risk of hyperkalaemia: Rifampicin does not cause hyperkalaemia.\r\n\r\nF) Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: Rifampicin is not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.\r\n\r\nG) Increased risk of hypotension: This is not a known interaction of rifampicin or oral contraceptives.\r\n\r\nH) Increased risk of serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome is not associated with either rifampicin or oral contraceptives.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend that rifampicin, a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, should not be co-prescribed with combined oral contraceptives without discussing alternative contraceptive options. Hormonal contraceptives may not provide reliable contraception when used with enzyme inducers. The patient should be counselled to use a barrier method, such as condoms, during and for 28 days after completing rifampicin treatment. Additionally, healthcare providers should educate patients on the increased risk of pregnancy and the importance of adherence to alternative contraception methods.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 7 ( Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\n30:2\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Resuscitation Council UK guidelines, when performing CPR on infants (under 1 year old):\r\n\r\nIf you are a single rescuer, the recommended chest compression to breath ratio is 30 compressions to 2 breaths, regardless of age \u2014 including babies, children, and adults.\r\n\r\nThis standardisation makes it easier for lone rescuers to apply CPR consistently across all patients.\r\n\r\nChest Compressions:\r\n\r\nRate: 100\u2013120 compressions per minute\r\n\r\nDepth: Approximately 4 cm, or one-third of the anterior-posterior chest diameter\r\n\r\nTechnique:\r\n\r\nFor a lone rescuer, use two fingers placed in the centre of the chest on the lower half of the sternum.\r\n\r\nEnsure full chest recoil between compressions.\r\n\r\nRescue Breaths:\r\n\r\nDeliver each breath over 1 second.\r\n\r\nEnsure each breath makes the chest visibly rise.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to deliver breaths, chest compressions alone are still better than no CPR.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. 5:1: This ratio was previously recommended for newborn resuscitation but is no longer used for infants over 28 days old.\r\n\r\nB. 10:2: This ratio is not recognised for CPR at any age group in modern guidelines.\r\n\r\nC. 15:2: Used only if there are two or more trained rescuers for infants and children. Not correct for a lone rescuer.\r\n\r\nE. 50:2: Not a valid ratio for any resuscitation protocol.\r\n\r\nFor a single rescuer performing CPR on an infant, the compression to breath ratio is now 30:2.\r\nThis ensures a balance between oxygenation and perfusion while keeping CPR techniques unified across all age groups until further help arrives.\r\n\r\n- CPR should continue until professional emergency help arrives or the infant shows signs of life.\r\n\r\n- Familiarity with these updated guidelines is critical for safe, effective, and life-saving resuscitation efforts.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course\r\n\r\nread this for more info: https://www.resus.org.uk/",

    "text": "A 40-year-old woman with a history of migraines is prescribed an antiemetic for her condition. After a few days of starting the medication, she presents to the emergency department with an oculogyric crisis, characterised by a sustained, involuntary upward deviation of both eyes.",
    "why": "Metoclopramide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMetoclopramide, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, is a commonly used antiemetic for nausea and vomiting, particularly in migraine treatment. However, it is known to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), including acute dystonic reactions.\r\n\r\nOculogyric crisis is a type of acute dystonia where the eyes deviate involuntarily upward, often accompanied by other muscle spasms. This occurs due to dopamine blockade in the basal ganglia, leading to disinhibition of the oculomotor pathways.\r\n\r\nYounger patients, especially women under 40 years, are more susceptible to dystonic reactions caused by metoclopramide. This risk is why NICE and MHRA guidelines recommend that metoclopramide use be limited to short-term (\u22645 days) treatment, with a maximum dose of 10 mg three times daily.\r\n\r\nTreatment of oculogyric crisis involves stopping the offending drug and administering intramuscular procyclidine, a centrally acting anticholinergic that helps reverse the dystonic reaction.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Domperidone\r\n\r\nDomperidone is also a D2 receptor antagonist, but it primarily acts peripherally and does not cross the blood-brain barrier significantly. Therefore, it is much less likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects.\r\n\r\nC: Ondansetron\r\n\r\nOndansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, commonly used for chemotherapy-induced nausea. It does not affect dopamine pathways and does not cause dystonic reactions.\r\n\r\nD: Prochlorperazine\r\n\r\nProchlorperazine is a phenothiazine (D2 receptor antagonist) and can also cause oculogyric crisis. However, metoclopramide is more commonly associated with this reaction, especially in younger patients.\r\n\r\nE: None of the above\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because metoclopramide is the most likely cause of oculogyric crisis in this scenario.\r\n\r\nMetoclopramide is a prokinetic antiemetic used to treat nausea and vomiting, including that associated with migraine, gastroparesis, and post-operative recovery. According to NICE guidelines and BNF, metoclopramide can cause extrapyramidal side effects, especially in young adults and at high doses. To reduce this risk, the MHRA restricts its use to a maximum of 5 days, with a dose limit of 10 mg three times daily. If a dystonic reaction occurs, treatment should be stopped immediately, and intramuscular procyclidine or benztropine should be administered to counteract the extrapyramidal effects. Patients should be educated about the signs of dystonia and advised to seek medical attention if symptoms occur.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",
