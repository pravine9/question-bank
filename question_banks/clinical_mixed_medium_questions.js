    "text": "A 60-year-old man presents to your pharmacy with a history of dyspepsia and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) for the last three months. He has been taking omeprazole 20 mg once daily and antacids as needed, but his symptoms have not improved. He also complains of occasional difficulty swallowing solid foods and a loss of appetite. He has no other medical conditions or allergies.",
    "why": "D) He should be referred urgently to a gastroenterologist via the suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks).\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient is 60 years old and has a history of dyspepsia and GORD for three months, but his symptoms have not improved with omeprazole and antacids. Additionally, he presents with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing solids) and loss of appetite, which are red flag symptoms requiring urgent investigation for a serious underlying pathology, including oesophageal or gastric cancer. According to NICE NG12 guidelines, urgent referral for suspected cancer is warranted in any adult with dysphagia, regardless of other symptoms (eg. weight loss).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Increase omeprazole to 40 mg once daily and continue with antacids as needed.\r\n\r\nWhile a higher dose of omeprazole is sometimes used for persistent GORD symptoms, it is not appropriate here. The presence of dysphagia is a red flag symptom that requires further investigation rather than simply increasing acid suppression therapy.\r\n\r\nB) Stop omeprazole and switch to an H2-receptor antagonist such as famotidine 20 mg twice daily.\r\n\r\nH2-receptor antagonists can be used for acid-related conditions, but switching to one does not address the patient\u2019s alarming symptoms. Dysphagia requires an urgent referral rather than a change in medication.\r\n\r\nC) Test for Helicobacter pylori infection using a carbon-13 urea breath test or stool antigen test.\r\n\r\nH. pylori infection can cause peptic ulcers and some cases of dyspepsia, but it is not the first-line investigation in a patient with dysphagia, as this symptom raises concern for malignancy or stricture. Referral for endoscopy is the priority.\r\n\r\nE) Try complementary and alternative therapies such as acupuncture, reflexology, or herbal remedies.\r\n\r\nWhile some patients find alternative therapies beneficial for general wellbeing, they do not address serious symptoms like dysphagia, which requires urgent medical evaluation.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend urgent referral (suspected cancer pathway) for patients with dysphagia or those over 55 with weight loss and other upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Dysphagia is a serious symptom that always warrants further investigation to rule out malignancy.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 1 ( Gastro Intestinal ):\r\n\r\nhttps://www.preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 65-year-old man with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presents to the pharmacy with a prescription for omeprazole 20 mg once daily. He also takes amlodipine 5 mg once daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily. He complains of muscle weakness, cramps, and palpitations. His blood test results show:\r\n\r\n- Serum sodium: 138 mmol/L (normal range: 135-145 mmol/L)\r\n- Serum potassium: 3.2 mmol/L (normal range: 3.5-5.0 mmol/L)\r\n- Serum magnesium: 0.6 mmol/L (normal range: 0.7-1.0 mmol/L)\r\n- Serum calcium: 2.1 mmol/L (normal range: 2.2-2.6 mmol/L)",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE) Omeprazole-induced hypomagnesaemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nProton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole are associated with hypomagnesaemia, especially with long-term use. Magnesium plays a vital role in maintaining normal potassium and calcium levels. Low magnesium impairs the function of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, contributing to hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia.\r\n\r\nThis triad of low magnesium, potassium, and calcium in a patient taking a PPI strongly suggests PPI-induced electrolyte abnormalities.\r\n\r\nMHRA has issued safety alerts warning about serious hypomagnesaemia linked to PPI use, particularly with prolonged therapy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Amlodipine-induced hypocalcaemia\r\n\r\nAmlodipine is a calcium channel blocker but does not significantly affect serum calcium levels.\r\n\r\nB) CKD-induced hyponatraemia\r\n\r\nCKD can lead to fluid retention but this patient\u2019s sodium is within the normal range, and there is no evidence of dilutional hyponatraemia.\r\n\r\nC) GORD-induced metabolic alkalosis\r\n\r\nGORD itself does not cause electrolyte disturbances. Alkalosis might be caused by vomiting or overuse of antacids, not mentioned here.\r\n\r\nD) Hydrochlorothiazide-induced hypokalaemia\r\n\r\nHydrochlorothiazide can cause potassium loss, but this would not explain the coexisting hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia seen here. The underlying issue is better explained by PPI use.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Proton pump inhibitors, especially omeprazole, are linked to hypomagnesaemia, which may be severe and cause secondary hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia.\r\n\r\n- This effect may occur even after years of use, and symptoms include weakness, cramps, arrhythmias, and seizures.\r\n\r\n- Magnesium should be checked periodically in patients on long-term PPIs.\r\n\r\n- Correction of magnesium deficiency often improves associated potassium and calcium levels.\r\n\r\n- BNF and MHRA recommend reviewing long-term PPI therapy in patients with unexplained electrolyte disturbances.",

    "text": "A 10-year-old boy has been taking montelukast 5 mg daily for the past 6 months for his asthma. His mother reports that he has been having nightmares, mood swings, and difficulty concentrating at school. She is concerned that these symptoms may be related to his medication. She asks you for advice on what to do.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nD. Tell her to withhold and be alert for any signs of suicidal behaviour or hallucinations and urgent refer to GP.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Montelukast is associated with neuropsychiatric side effects, including:\r\n\r\n- Nightmares\r\n\r\n- Mood swings\r\n\r\n- Aggression\r\n\r\n- Depression\r\n\r\n- Suicidal ideation\r\n\r\nThese effects are listed in the BNF for Children and have been emphasised in MHRA safety updates (April 2024), which state that montelukast should be discontinued if neuropsychiatric symptoms develop or worsen.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a community pharmacy setting, we do not have the authority to stop a prescribed medicine independently unless it's a clear emergency. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to advise the parent to withhold monitor closely for serious signs (e.g. suicidal thoughts or hallucinations) and to urgently refer the child to their GP. The prescriber can then assess and make an informed decision about stopping or changing the medication.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Tell her to stop giving him montelukast immediately and seek urgent medical attention\r\n\r\nAlthough the symptoms are concerning, pharmacists should not instruct patients to stop a prescribed medicine without a prescriber\u2019s review \u2014 unless it\u2019s an emergency (e.g., anaphylaxis). This approach would be beyond the pharmacist\u2019s scope in this context.\r\n\r\nB. Tell her to continue giving him montelukast as normal and reassure her that these symptoms are common and harmless\r\n\r\nDismissing symptoms like nightmares and mood swings, especially in children, is inappropriate and potentially dangerous \u2014 these could be signs of serious adverse drug reactions.\r\n\r\nC. Tell her to reduce the dose of montelukast to 4 mg daily and monitor his symptoms for any improvement\r\n\r\nDose adjustments must be made by the prescriber. The 4 mg dose is not suitable for a 10-year-old (it's for children aged 2\u20135). Making dose changes without a prescriber is unsafe and unprofessional.\r\n\r\nE. Tell her to give him montelukast in the morning instead of the evening and see if that helps with his sleep problems\r\n\r\nWhile morning dosing has been suggested in some mild cases of sleep disturbance, this does not address the broader concern of multiple neuropsychiatric effects. This would risk underreacting to a potentially serious situation.\r\n\r\nSummary of Key Guidance:\r\n\r\n- MHRA (2024) warns of neuropsychiatric reactions with montelukast.\r\n\r\n- BNFC recommends stopping the drug if serious behavioural symptoms occur, but this should be done under prescriber supervision.\r\n\r\n- As pharmacists, our role is to identify red flags and escalate appropriately, not to stop the medication ourselves unless it's an emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

First-line treatment includes:\r\n\r\n- Inhaled salbutamol (SABA) via a spacer or nebuliser\r\n\r\n- If symptoms persist or are severe, add a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone).\r\n\r\n- Long-term inhaled corticosteroids are only considered for children with frequent exacerbations or diagnosed asthma.\r\n\r\nFor children without a history of asthma, inhaled corticosteroids are not routinely recommended after a single episode of viral wheeze. Prednisolone remains the first choice for severe cases, helping to reduce hospital admissions and symptom severity.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: C) A LABA and a LAMA\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient belongs to Group B according to the GOLD ABCD assessment tool, which is based on both the patient's symptoms and exacerbation risk. This patient has moderate symptoms (CAT score of 12, mMRC score of 2) and low exacerbation risk (one moderate exacerbation in the past year). \r\n\r\nThe recommended initial treatment for Group B is dual bronchodilation, which involves a LABA (Long-Acting Beta-2 Agonist) and a LAMA (Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist), as this combination is most effective in improving symptoms and lung function.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) A short-acting bronchodilator as needed \u2013 Incorrect. While a short-acting bronchodilator (like salbutamol) can be used for symptom relief, this patient has more significant symptoms (CAT score of 12) that warrant a more comprehensive treatment, such as LABA + LAMA.\r\n\r\nB) A LAMA and ICS \u2013 Incorrect. Although LAMA + ICS may be used in certain COPD patients, the patient's exacerbation history (one moderate exacerbation in the past year) and moderate symptoms do not require the addition of ICS. LABA + LAMA would be more appropriate for Group B.\r\n\r\nD) A LABA and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. Combining LABA and ICS is typically recommended for patients with higher exacerbation risk or elevated eosinophil levels. This patient has a relatively low exacerbation risk, so dual bronchodilation (LABA + LAMA) would be more suitable.\r\n\r\nE) A LABA, a LAMA, and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. While triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) is an option for patients with more severe COPD or high exacerbation risk, this patient has a low exacerbation risk and moderate symptoms, so dual bronchodilation (LABA + LAMA) is the preferred first-line therapy.\r\n\r\nF) Azithromycin \u2013 Incorrect. Azithromycin is typically used in patients with frequent exacerbations, particularly when infections are contributing. This patient has one moderate exacerbation in the past year, making azithromycin unnecessary at this stage.\r\n\r\nG) Carbocisteine \u2013 Incorrect. Carbocisteine is a mucolytic agent that may be used in patients with chronic productive cough. However, it is not first-line treatment for a patient like this with a relatively low symptom burden and moderate exacerbation risk.\r\n\r\nH) Theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. Theophylline is an older medication with limited efficacy and a higher side effect profile compared to newer inhalers like LABA and LAMA. It is not recommended as a first-line treatment for COPD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

His peak expiratory flow rate is 75% of his personal best.",
    "why": "Correct answer: B) Prescribe a combination inhaler containing low-dose ICS and LABA (e.g. formoterol) for maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)\r\n\r\nRationale:\u2028According to the updated 2024 NICE guidelines, adults and young people (aged 12 and over) with newly diagnosed or uncontrolled asthma should be started on a low-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler that can be used both as maintenance and reliever therapy (MART). This approach simplifies treatment, improves adherence, and reduces exacerbation risk by ensuring regular anti-inflammatory treatment even when used as needed.\r\nInhalers combining formoterol (a fast-acting LABA) with an ICS (e.g. beclometasone or budesonide) allow for symptom relief and long-term control, aligning with the AIR and MART strategy endorsed by NICE.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Prescribe a low-dose ICS such as beclometasone or budesonide - Incorrect. While previously considered the next first step, updated NICE guidelines now recommend initiating with ICS/LABA MART, not ICS monotherapy, for most adults.\r\n\r\nC) Prescribe a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) such as montelukast \u2013 Incorrect. LTRAs may be considered as add-on therapy, but not as initial treatment. This would be started is MART didn\u2019t help \r\n\r\nD) Prescribe a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) such as tiotropium \u2013 Incorrect. LAMAs are used as step-up therapy in severe or poorly controlled asthma, not at diagnosis. This would be started is MART didn\u2019t help \r\n\r\nE) Prescribe a monoclonal antibody such as omalizumab or mepolizumab \u2013 Incorrect. Monoclonal antibodies are reserved for severe asthma with eosinophilic or allergic phenotypes after failure of high-dose ICS/LABA and other therapies.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* NICE now recommends ICS/formoterol MART as first-line treatment for adults with new or poorly controlled asthma.\r\n* Formoterol / ICS combination is suitable for both relief and prevention, making it ideal for MART.\r\n* This strategy reduces reliance on SABAs and helps manage both day-to-day symptoms and prevent exacerbations.\r\n* Personalised asthma plans should be developed alongside initiation of therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 25-year-old man with asthma is prescribed a Fostair (Beclomethasone / Formoterol) inhaler and a spacer device. He is advised to clean the spacer once a month using detergent and to leave it to air-dry without rinsing. However, he forgets to clean the spacer and continues using it for six months without washing it. Over time, he notices that his asthma symptoms are worsening, and he requires more frequent use of his inhaler.",
    "why": "Correct answer: E) The spacer device has developed a static charge\r\n\r\nSpacer devices, if not cleaned regularly or incorrectly maintained, can accumulate static charge. This static charge causes the aerosolised medication particles to stick to the sides of the spacer instead of being inhaled into the lungs. As a result, the delivered dose of inhaled Foster dose is reduced, leading to suboptimal asthma control. NICE and national guidelines recommend monthly cleaning with detergent and air drying without rinsing to reduce static build-up and ensure effective medication delivery.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\nA) The Foster inhaler has lost its potency \u2013 Incorrect. Inhalers generally remain effective if stored properly within expiry dates. The issue here is reduced delivery via the spacer, not the inhaler itself.\r\n\r\nB) The patient has developed an allergy to the detergent \u2013 Incorrect. There is no evidence the patient has used detergent or developed allergy symptoms. In fact, he didn\u2019t clean the spacer at all.\r\n\r\nC) The patient has developed a psychological dependence on the inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. The patient is requiring more frequent use due to poor control, not dependence.\r\n\r\nD) The spacer device has become contaminated with bacteria \u2013 Incorrect. While contamination could occur over time, the main clinical issue affecting drug delivery in this case is static charge, not infection.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n* Static charge in spacers reduces drug delivery to the lungs.\r\n* Monthly cleaning with detergent and air-drying without rinsing is best practice.\r\n* Poor spacer maintenance is a common cause of worsening asthma symptoms despite adherence.\r\n* Regular reviews of inhaler and spacer technique can improve asthma outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):  https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

However, it does not lower blood pressure, making it less suitable for this patient with stage 2 hypertension.\r\n\r\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men, causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as difficulty initiating urination, weak flow, and incomplete bladder emptying. According to NICE NG12, the management of BPH depends on the severity of symptoms. For patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists (e.g., tamsulosin, doxazosin) are recommended first-line.\r\n\r\nIn patients with BPH and coexisting hypertension, doxazosin is preferred because it provides dual benefits by improving urinary symptoms and lowering blood pressure. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor symptom relief, assess blood pressure, and manage any side effects, such as postural hypotension.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Desmopressin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDesmopressin is the most appropriate treatment for nocturnal enuresis in adults when behavioural therapies (e.g., fluid restriction, alarm devices) have failed. It is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) that reduces urine production during the night by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. This decreases the volume of urine produced, helping to prevent bedwetting. It is safe and effective for patients with no contraindications or significant comorbidities.\r\n\r\nDesmopressin is typically administered as a tablet or melt formulation before bedtime. Patients should avoid excessive fluid intake in the evening to reduce the risk of hyponatraemia, a rare but serious adverse effect.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Alprostadil\r\n\r\nAlprostadil is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It has no role in the management of nocturnal enuresis.\r\n\r\nB: Duloxetine\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is used for stress urinary incontinence, particularly in women.

It relaxes the detrusor muscle to increase bladder capacity but is not suitable for nocturnal enuresis.\r\n\r\nE: Oxybutynin\r\n\r\nOxybutynin is an anticholinergic used to manage overactive bladder. It reduces involuntary detrusor contractions but is not effective in reducing nocturnal urine production.\r\n\r\nF: Sildenafil\r\n\r\nSildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction. It has no role in managing nocturnal enuresis.\r\n\r\nG: Solifenacin\r\n\r\nSolifenacin is another anticholinergic used for overactive bladder syndrome. It does not reduce urine production and is not appropriate for nocturnal enuresis.\r\n\r\nH: Tolterodine\r\n\r\nTolterodine is an anticholinergic indicated for overactive bladder but has no role in treating nocturnal enuresis.\r\n\r\nThe management of nocturnal enuresis should begin with non-pharmacological interventions, such as lifestyle advice, fluid restriction in the evening, and alarm devices. If these fail, desmopressin is recommended as first-line pharmacological therapy for adults and children over the age of 5 years, as per NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) and BNF guidance. Desmopressin works by mimicking the action of vasopressin to reduce urine production at night, effectively managing symptoms. Monitoring for hyponatraemia is essential, especially in patients who may drink excess fluids. Patients should also be counselled on proper medication use, including taking desmopressin at bedtime and limiting fluid intake in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

If oral therapy fails, alprostadil is recommended as the next step. Alprostadil can be delivered via intraurethral pellets, intracavernosal injection, or as a topical preparation, depending on patient preference and tolerance. Lifestyle modifications, addressing underlying health conditions, and psychological support are also essential components of ED management.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "A. Continue taking ulipristal acetate 5 mg as prescribed and monitor her liver function before, during, and after each course of treatment.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUlipristal acetate 5 mg is authorised for intermittent therapy in moderate to severe uterine fibroid symptoms when surgical procedures are not suitable. However, it has been associated with serious liver injury, including liver failure requiring transplantation. The MHRA has issued guidance restricting its use and emphasising the need for liver function monitoring before starting treatment, during therapy, and after completing each course. These precautions aim to minimise the risk of severe liver complications while enabling patients to benefit from the medication.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Continue taking ulipristal acetate 5 mg as prescribed but reduce the duration of each course of treatment from 3 months to 2 months.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence supporting a reduced course duration to mitigate liver injury risks. The recommended course duration is 3 months, with liver function monitoring as stipulated.\r\n\r\nC. Continue taking ulipristal acetate 5 mg as prescribed but increase the interval between each course of treatment from 1 menstrual cycle to 2 menstrual cycles.\r\n\r\nExtending the interval between treatment courses is not an evidence-based approach to reducing liver injury risks. Monitoring liver function as per guidelines is the recommended method to ensure safety.\r\n\r\nD. Continue taking ulipristal acetate 5 mg as prescribed but use additional contraception, such as condoms, during each course of treatment.\r\n\r\nAlthough contraception is recommended to avoid pregnancy during treatment, this does not address the primary concern of liver injury, which requires appropriate monitoring.\r\n\r\nE. Stop taking ulipristal acetate 5 mg immediately and seek alternative treatment options for her uterine fibroids.\r\n\r\nThis option is not appropriate unless the patient has a contraindication, such as underlying liver disease, or opts against continuing treatment after being informed of the risks and benefits.\r\n\r\nIn line with NICE and MHRA guidance, ulipristal acetate 5 mg can be used for eligible patients with moderate to severe uterine fibroids when surgical options are unsuitable. Patients must be informed about the risks of liver injury and adhere to strict liver function monitoring schedules to mitigate these risks. Liver function tests are mandatory before starting therapy, monthly during treatment, and after the treatment ends. This ensures the safe administration of the drug while allowing patients to make informed decisions about their care.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

However, it is important to monitor blood pressure during treatment, as hypertension can become a concern with cyclophosphamide, especially at higher doses.\r\n\r\nCyclophosphamide is contraindicated in the following conditions:\r\n\r\nPregnancy: It is teratogenic and can harm the fetus.\r\nLactation: It is contraindicated during breastfeeding as it can pass into breast milk and affect the infant.\r\nActive infection: Cyclophosphamide suppresses the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infections.\r\nNeutropenia: As cyclophosphamide can suppress bone marrow function, it may cause neutropenia, and its use is contraindicated in patients with severe bone marrow suppression.\r\n\r\nExplanation Of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Active infection: Incorrect. Active infection is a contraindication to cyclophosphamide due to its immunosuppressive effects.\r\n\r\nC. Lactation: Incorrect. Lactation is a contraindication to cyclophosphamide as it can pass into breast milk, potentially harming the infant.\r\n\r\nD. Neutropenia: Incorrect. Neutropenia, or severe bone marrow impairment, is a contraindication because cyclophosphamide can further suppress bone marrow function.\r\n\r\nE. Pregnancy: Incorrect. Pregnancy is a contraindication to cyclophosphamide as it is teratogenic and can harm the fetus.\r\n\r\nCyclophosphamide is commonly used in the treatment of various malignancies, including breast cancer, and is typically part of combination regimens like CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil). According to NICE guidelines, cyclophosphamide should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by the drug, such as active infections, severe neutropenia, or impaired renal function. The immunosuppressive nature of cyclophosphamide can increase the risk of infections, requiring careful monitoring of blood counts and signs of infection throughout treatment. It is also important to monitor for potential cardiovascular effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation due to its teratogenic effects and the potential harm it can cause to a breastfeeding infant. By adhering to these precautions, healthcare professionals can manage the potential risks associated with cyclophosphamide and optimise therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "E. 5 mg/kg every 6 - 8 weeks\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor ankylosing spondylitis, the SmPC for infliximab recommends:\r\n\r\nAn induction phase with infliximab administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6, each at a dose of 5 mg/kg.\r\nFollowing the induction phase, a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks is used, depending on the patient's clinical response.\r\nThis regimen has been shown to effectively reduce inflammation, improve symptoms, and maintain disease control in patients with severe axial symptoms who have not responded to conventional therapies such as NSAIDs or physiotherapy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 3 mg/kg every 6 weeks:\r\nThis is an inappropriate dose for ankylosing spondylitis. The 3 mg/kg dose is used for rheumatoid arthritis, not ankylosing spondylitis, where a higher dose of 5 mg/kg is required.\r\n\r\nB. 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks:\r\nLike option A, this dosing is recommended for rheumatoid arthritis. It is too low for patients with ankylosing spondylitis and would likely be insufficient for symptom control.\r\n\r\nC. 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks:\r\nWhile this is a possible dosing interval for some patients, the SmPC specifies every 6\u20138 weeks for ankylosing spondylitis. This option could be correct depending on the patient's individual response, but \"every 6\u20138 weeks\" (option E) is the most accurate answer.\r\n\r\nD. 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks:\r\nThis dosing interval is suitable for patients who require a shorter maintenance interval due to a more aggressive disease course or suboptimal control with 8-week intervals. However, the SmPC specifies a range of 6\u20138 weeks rather than a strict 6-week interval.\r\n\r\nF. 5 mg/kg every 14 weeks:\r\nThis is not a recognised dosing interval for infliximab in ankylosing spondylitis. Such long intervals could lead to disease flares and loss of symptom control.\r\n\r\nG. 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks:\r\nA dose of 10 mg/kg is used in certain severe cases, such as ulcerative colitis, when the standard dose of 5 mg/kg is inadequate. However, this is not the standard dosing for ankylosing spondylitis.\r\n\r\nH. 10 mg/kg every 6 weeks:\r\nThis dose is excessively high and is not supported by the SmPC for ankylosing spondylitis. It would likely increase the risk of adverse effects without additional benefit.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend TNF-alpha inhibitors, including infliximab, for patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have:\r\n\r\nSevere axial symptoms \r\nHave failed to respond adequately to first-line therapies such as NSAIDs or physiotherapy.\r\nInfliximab reduces inflammation, improves spinal mobility, and alleviates pain. The dosing regimen aims to balance therapeutic benefit with safety by tailoring the interval based on patient response.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "5 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a patient with Crohn's disease who has severe active disease and has not responded to conventional therapy, the SmPC for infliximab recommends the following:\r\n\r\nInitial dose: 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6.\r\nMaintenance dose: 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.\r\nThis dosing schedule is aimed at managing moderate to severe active Crohn's disease in patients who have failed conventional treatments such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine), and aminosalicylates. The goal of this therapy is to induce and maintain remission in patients who have not responded to conventional therapy.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Other Options:\r\n3 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis is an underdose for the treatment of Crohn's disease. The recommended dose for moderate to severe cases is 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for maintenance.\r\n\r\n3 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nWhile this could be used for milder cases of Crohn's disease, it is generally not sufficient for patients with severe active disease who have not responded to conventional therapy. The recommended maintenance dose is 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis dosing schedule is more frequent than needed for most patients with moderate to severe active disease. The standard maintenance dose for Crohn's disease is 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Reducing the interval to 6 weeks is not supported by the SmPC unless specific adjustments are warranted due to disease severity.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks\r\n\r\nWhile this is close to the correct maintenance regimen, the SmPC specifies a clear maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, making 6\u20138 weeks a slightly broader option that is less ideal compared to the precise recommendation of 8 weeks.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 14 weeks\r\n\r\nExtending the maintenance dose to every 14 weeks would likely not provide sufficient therapeutic benefit for patients with active disease and could lead to disease relapse. The SmPC recommends a dose every 8 weeks for optimal efficacy.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nThis higher dose is generally used for refractory cases of Crohn's disease that do not respond to standard doses (e.g., 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks). However, 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks is the first-line recommended dose for most patients with severe active disease.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThe 6-week interval with 10 mg/kg is a much higher dose and more frequent regimen than recommended for the majority of patients with Crohn's disease. This dosing is typically used in more refractory or resistant cases, but it is not the initial or standard treatment.\r\n\r\nMonitoring: Patients receiving infliximab for Crohn's disease should be closely monitored for infusion reactions, infections, and potential immunosuppression. Regular follow-up with a gastroenterologist is advised to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust dosing if needed.\r\nAdjustments: In cases of insufficient response, a dose escalation to 10 mg/kg may be considered. However, for most patients, the standard dose of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks will be sufficient to maintain remission.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines also align with the SmPC, recommending 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who have failed conventional therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 1 (Gastro Intestinal system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

Asthma\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, characterised by:\r\n\r\nRecurrent episodes of shortness of breath, wheeze, and cough, especially at night or early morning.\r\nReversible airflow obstruction triggered by allergens, exercise, or irritants.\r\nAssociation with atopic conditions such as eczema and allergic rhinitis, which are present in this patient.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, asthma is diagnosed based on a clinical assessment, supported by objective tests such as:\r\n\r\nSpirometry: Assessing airflow limitation.\r\nBronchodilator reversibility testing: Demonstrating reversibility of obstruction.\r\nFeNO testing: Measuring airway inflammation if available.\r\nThis patient's history of atopy and symptoms of episodic wheeze, cough, and dyspnoea align closely with asthma.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nB. Bronchitis\r\nBronchitis typically involves a productive cough with mucus and is associated with infection or smoking. It is not recurrent or linked to atopy.\r\n\r\nC.

This patient\u2019s presentation does not suggest TB.\r\n\r\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterised by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough. Symptoms are often worse at night or triggered by allergens, exercise, or cold air. It is strongly associated with atopic conditions like eczema and allergic rhinitis.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis:\r\n\r\nAsthma is diagnosed through a combination of:\r\n\r\nClinical history (episodic symptoms and triggers).\r\nObjective tests: Spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility, FeNO testing, and peak flow variability.\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\n\r\nReliever inhalers (e.g., salbutamol) for acute symptoms.\r\nPreventer therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for long-term control.\r\nTrigger avoidance and proper inhaler technique are essential.\r\nThis patient's recurrent symptoms, reliance on a reliever inhaler, and history of atopy strongly suggest asthma, highlighting the need for preventer therapy to improve symptom control and prevent exacerbations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "D: Pelvic floor muscle training\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient is experiencing stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is characterised by involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing. According to NICE NG123, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first-line treatment for stress incontinence in women.\r\n\r\nPFMT involves strengthening the pelvic floor muscles by performing contractions at least 8 times per session, 3 times a day. Regular PFMT has been shown to improve symptoms, enhance bladder control, and significantly improve quality of life. It is non-invasive, has no side effects, and is highly recommended as an initial intervention before considering pharmacological or surgical treatments.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Bladder neck suspension surgery\r\n\r\nThis is a surgical option for severe or refractory stress incontinence, but it is not first-line treatment. Surgery is only considered when conservative measures, such as PFMT, have failed.\r\n\r\nB: Duloxetine capsules\r\n\r\nDuloxetine, an SNRI, can be used as second-line pharmacological therapy for stress incontinence, particularly if PFMT is ineffective or not feasible. However, it is not a first-line option due to the potential for side effects such as nausea and dizziness.\r\n\r\nC: Oxybutynin tablets\r\n\r\nOxybutynin is an antimuscarinic used to treat overactive bladder syndrome. It is not effective for stress incontinence and may exacerbate symptoms by causing urinary retention.\r\n\r\nE: Vaginal oestrogen cream\r\n\r\nVaginal oestrogen may improve incontinence in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy, but it is not a first-line treatment for stress incontinence. It may be used as an adjunct to PFMT in postmenopausal women.\r\n\r\nStress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition in women, often resulting from weakened pelvic floor muscles. NICE NG123 recommends pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) as the first-line treatment for SUI. PFMT strengthens the pelvic floor muscles, improving bladder control and reducing leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure. Women should be supported with information on how to perform PFMT correctly, and referral to a physiotherapist specialising in pelvic health may be beneficial for guidance.\r\n\r\nIf PFMT is insufficient or symptoms persist, other options include pharmacological treatment with duloxetine or surgical interventions such as bladder neck suspension or urethral sling procedures. In postmenopausal women with coexisting vaginal atrophy, vaginal oestrogen can be considered as an adjunct therapy.\r\n\r\nRegular follow-up and patient engagement are essential to assess progress and optimise management strategies.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Mirabegron\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMirabegron is the most appropriate treatment for overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) in this patient due to its mechanism of action and safety profile. Mirabegron is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist that relaxes the detrusor muscle, increasing bladder capacity and reducing symptoms of urgency, frequency, and nocturia. It is particularly suitable for patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, as it does not have the anticholinergic effects that could exacerbate this condition.\r\n\r\nAnticholinergic drugs (e.g., oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine) are contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma because they can worsen intraocular pressure and lead to serious complications.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Alprostadil\r\n\r\nAlprostadil is used for erectile dysfunction and has no role in managing overactive bladder syndrome.\r\n\r\nB: Duloxetine\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is indicated for stress urinary incontinence but is not appropriate for managing OAB symptoms like urgency and nocturia.\r\n\r\nC: Desmopressin\r\n\r\nDesmopressin is used to reduce urine production in conditions like nocturnal enuresis or diabetes insipidus. It does not address the detrusor overactivity seen in OAB.\r\n\r\nE: Oxybutynin\r\n\r\nOxybutynin is an anticholinergic used for OAB, but it is contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma due to its potential to increase intraocular pressure.\r\n\r\nF: Sildenafil\r\n\r\nSildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction. It has no role in OAB management.\r\n\r\nG: Solifenacin\r\n\r\nSolifenacin is another anticholinergic used for OAB, but like oxybutynin, it is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.\r\n\r\nH: Tolterodine\r\n\r\nTolterodine is also an anticholinergic for OAB but is contraindicated in narrow-angle glaucoma.\r\n\r\nOveractive bladder syndrome (OAB) is characterised by urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia, often without a clear underlying cause. According to NICE NG123, initial management should include lifestyle modifications and bladder training. When pharmacological treatment is required, anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin, solifenacin) are commonly used. However, in patients where anticholinergics are contraindicated (e.g., narrow-angle glaucoma), mirabegron is recommended as first-line therapy. It provides effective symptom relief without the risks associated with anticholinergic agents.\r\n\r\nRegular follow-up is essential to assess symptom control, adherence, and side effects. Patients should also be counselled on the benefits and potential risks of treatment to ensure informed decision-making.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 25-year-old woman with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease presents to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding. She has a positive urine pregnancy test and her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. An ultrasound scan shows a pregnancy outside of the uterus. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 90 beats per minute, and temperature is 36.5\u00b0C. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level is 1500 IU/L.",
    "why": "D. Methotrexate\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is the first-line treatment for stable ectopic pregnancies that meet specific criteria, such as haemodynamic stability, no signs of rupture, and low serum hCG levels (generally less than 5000 IU/L). It works by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which disrupts DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, effectively halting the growth of the ectopic pregnancy. It is administered as a single intramuscular injection.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient has an ectopic pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound and a positive hCG test. She is haemodynamically stable (normal blood pressure and pulse rate), and her hCG level (1500 IU/L) is low enough to consider medical management with methotrexate as per NICE guidelines. Methotrexate is preferred for non-surgical management when the patient is stable, hCG levels are below 5000 IU/L, and there is no significant pain or signs of rupture.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Expectant management:\r\n\r\nThis involves monitoring the patient without active intervention. It is only suitable when the patient is asymptomatic, haemodynamically stable, and has declining hCG levels, suggesting that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving on its own. This patient does not meet these criteria due to her rising hCG levels and confirmed ectopic pregnancy.\r\n\r\nB. Laparotomy:\r\n\r\nThis is a surgical procedure involving a large abdominal incision. It is reserved for patients who are haemodynamically unstable, have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or where laparoscopy is not feasible. The patient is stable and does not show signs of rupture, so this option is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nC. Laparoscopy:\r\n\r\nThis is a minimally invasive surgical procedure and the preferred option for treating ectopic pregnancy in patients with haemodynamic stability who cannot undergo methotrexate treatment (e.g., high hCG levels, pain, or contraindications to methotrexate). While it is a valid alternative, medical management is favoured in this scenario.\r\n\r\nE. Mifepristone:\r\n\r\nMifepristone is an antiprogestogen used for medical termination of intrauterine pregnancies but is not effective for ectopic pregnancies. It does not target the ectopic site or its growth, making it inappropriate in this case.\r\n\r\nAn ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. According to NICE guidelines, methotrexate is the first-line treatment for stable ectopic pregnancies, provided the patient meets specific criteria such as no significant pain, haemodynamic stability, absence of rupture, and low serum hCG levels (usually <5000 IU/L). Methotrexate allows for non-surgical resolution of the ectopic pregnancy, minimising the risk of complications and preserving future fertility. Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical option for patients who cannot receive methotrexate or have contraindications. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are critical to reduce morbidity and preserve reproductive outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nA) Take colestyramine at least one hour before or four to six hours after any other medication to avoid drug interactions.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Colestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant that binds bile acids in the gut to prevent reabsorption, commonly used for bile salt diarrhoea, especially in conditions like short bowel syndrome.\r\n\r\n- However, colestyramine can interfere with the absorption of many oral medications, including:\r\n\r\n- Levothyroxine (critical interaction, reduced efficacy if bound)\r\n\r\n- Alendronic acid\r\n\r\n- Sertraline\r\n\r\n- Amlodipine\r\n\r\n- Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)\r\n\r\n- To reduce the risk of malabsorption or therapeutic failure, NICE and BNF recommend that colestyramine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 4\u20136 hours after other oral medications.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Take colestyramine with meals\r\n\r\nNot the most crucial advice. While it can be taken with meals, this does not mitigate the key risk of drug binding and reduced absorption.\r\n\r\nC) Take colestyramine with plenty of water\r\n\r\nHelpful advice, but not the priority in this context. Preventing drug interactions takes precedence over constipation here.\r\n\r\nD) Take colestyramine with a fat-soluble vitamin supplement\r\n\r\nFat-soluble vitamin deficiency can occur with long-term use, but supplementation is only advised after monitoring confirms deficiency, this is not first-line advice.\r\n\r\nE) Take colestyramine with an acid-blocking medication\r\n\r\nIncorrect.

He presents to your community pharmacy and reports feeling low, hopeless, and having thoughts of harming himself. He has no history of mental health problems or other medical conditions. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs.",
    "why": "D. Stop finasteride and monitor the patient's mood.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFinasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, is used to treat male pattern hair loss by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. However, the MHRA has reported cases of depression and suicidal thoughts in patients taking finasteride. The recommended action is to stop the medication immediately and monitor the patient's mood. This approach ensures the potential cause of the depressive symptoms is removed while closely observing the patient for any further deterioration or improvement. Immediate discontinuation helps to mitigate the risk of exacerbating psychiatric symptoms.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Continue finasteride and prescribe an antidepressant:\r\n\r\nThis is not appropriate as it does not address the root cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms. Continuing finasteride could worsen depression, and using an antidepressant to manage side effects of a potentially harmful drug is not ideal.\r\n\r\nB. Continue finasteride and refer the patient to a psychologist:\r\n\r\nAlthough psychological support may be beneficial, continuing finasteride when it could be contributing to depressive symptoms is not advised. Stopping the medication should be the first step.\r\n\r\nC. Stop finasteride and prescribe an antidepressant:\r\n\r\nWhile discontinuing finasteride is correct, immediately prescribing an antidepressant is unnecessary unless depressive symptoms persist or worsen after discontinuation. Monitoring the patient\u2019s mood initially is a more cautious approach.\r\n\r\nE. Stop finasteride and refer the patient to a psychologist:\r\n\r\nStopping finasteride is appropriate, but referral to a psychologist should be reserved for cases where symptoms persist or worsen despite discontinuation of the medication. Immediate referral may not be required.\r\n\r\nFinasteride, commonly prescribed for male pattern hair loss, has been linked to psychiatric adverse effects, including depression and suicidal ideation. The MHRA advises that patients experiencing depressive symptoms discontinue finasteride immediately and consult a healthcare professional. Monitoring the patient's mood after stopping the medication is crucial to ensure symptoms improve and to guide further treatment if necessary. NICE guidelines highlight the importance of stopping medications causing adverse effects before considering additional treatments. Patient education on recognising and reporting mood changes while on finasteride is essential for safe and effective care.\r\n\r\nFor more Information refer to BNF lesson Chapter 13 (skin), or refer to BNF chaoter 13 under the section on Drugs for Alopecia (13.9.2):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The regimen is administered intravenously to prepare the bone marrow for the transplant.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) 100 mg/m\u00b2 daily: This dose is more commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions or some cancers, but it is not the appropriate regimen for bone marrow transplantation conditioning.\r\n\r\nC) 500 mg/m\u00b2 every 2 weeks: This dosing schedule is typically used in the treatment of certain cancers, but for bone marrow transplantation, higher doses given over a short period (as in the 60 mg/kg for 2 days option) are preferred.\r\n\r\nD) 750 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks: This schedule is more suited for chemotherapy treatments, but it is not appropriate for bone marrow transplantation conditioning, which requires a more intense, short-term regimen.\r\n\r\nE) 1000 mg/m\u00b2 every 4 weeks: While this dose could be used in some cancer treatments, it is not used for bone marrow transplantation conditioning, where the dosing needs to be more concentrated and over a shorter time frame.\r\n\r\nConclusion: According to the SmPC for cyclophosphamide, the correct dosing regimen for preparation for bone marrow transplantation is 60 mg/kg for 2 days.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**\u2028\r\nThe SPmC for Infliximab has been provided for you:\u00a0[SmPC for infliximab](\r\nhttps://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3710/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "C) 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor patients with psoriatic arthritis who have peripheral arthritis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dose of infliximab is an initial dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. This dosing schedule is consistent with the SmPC recommendations and ensures effective control of both joint and skin symptoms.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) 3 mg/kg every 6 weeks: This lower dose is typically used for other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis but is not suitable for psoriatic arthritis with plaque psoriasis.\r\n\r\nB) 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks: Similar to the above, this dose is insufficient for psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, where a higher dose is required for efficacy.\r\n\r\nD) 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks: While closer to the correct dose, this dosing interval is more frequent than necessary, increasing the risk of side effects without additional benefits for this condition.\r\n\r\nE) 5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks: This is less precise than the recommended regimen of every 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nF) 5 mg/kg every 14 weeks: This interval is too long and would not maintain effective disease control.\r\n\r\nG) 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks: While this dose may be used for other severe conditions or in cases where the standard dose has failed, it is not routinely required for psoriatic arthritis with plaque psoriasis.\r\n\r\nH) 10 mg/kg every 6 weeks: This higher dose and shorter interval are excessive and not recommended for this indication.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nBased on the SmPC for infliximab, the most appropriate regimen for this patient is 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, following the initial induction doses. This schedule provides effective disease control with an appropriate safety profile.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

She forgot to apply a new patch at the start of week 3 and realised her mistake on Saturday morning. She had unprotected sex with her partner on Friday night.",
    "why": "A. Apply a new patch as soon as possible and use condoms for the next 7 days\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE and BNF guidelines, if the application of a new combined transdermal patch (CTP) is delayed by more than 48 hours, the contraceptive effect may be compromised. The patient should apply a new patch immediately and use additional contraception, such as condoms, for the next 7 days.\r\n\r\nSince the unprotected sexual intercourse occurred within the last 5 days (on Friday night), she should also consider emergency contraception. The need for emergency contraception depends on her individual circumstances, including her risk of pregnancy and the timing of ovulation.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Apply a new patch as soon as possible and no additional contraception is needed:\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because a delay of more than 48 hours in applying the patch requires additional contraception for 7 days to prevent pregnancy. Without additional contraception, the patient remains at risk of pregnancy during this period.\r\n\r\nC. Apply a new patch on the next Thursday and use condoms until then:\r\n\r\nDelaying the application of a new patch until the next Thursday is not recommended. The patient should apply a patch as soon as she realises her mistake, as a delay of this length increases the risk of ovulation and subsequent pregnancy.\r\n\r\nD. Apply a new patch on the next Thursday and use emergency contraception as soon as possible:\r\n\r\nWhile emergency contraception might be appropriate due to the unprotected intercourse, delaying the application of a new patch until the next Thursday leaves her unprotected and at further risk of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nE. Do not apply any more patches and use condoms until the next period:\r\n\r\nThis is not recommended because it does not re-establish hormonal contraception. The patient would also remain at risk of pregnancy from the unprotected intercourse and would need emergency contraception if she opts not to continue the patch.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend that if a delay in applying a new patch exceeds 48 hours, women should apply a new patch as soon as possible, use additional contraception for the next 7 days, and consider emergency contraception if unprotected sex has occurred within the last 5 days. Emergency contraception options include levonorgestrel, ulipristal acetate, or a copper intrauterine device, depending on the timing and patient preference.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She is not using any regular contraception. She has been taking rifampicin and isoniazid for the treatment of tuberculosis for the last 2 months. She has no other medical conditions or allergies.",
    "why": "A. Copper intra-uterine device inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nRifampicin is a potent enzyme inducer that significantly reduces the efficacy of hormonal emergency contraceptives like levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate. The copper intra-uterine device (IUD) is the most effective form of emergency contraception and is unaffected by enzyme-inducing medications. It provides additional long-term contraceptive benefits after insertion. Mifepristone is not licensed for emergency contraception in the UK, and its use is not recommended.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg orally as soon as possible\r\n\r\nThis is a commonly used hormonal emergency contraceptive. However, its effectiveness is significantly reduced in the presence of enzyme inducers like rifampicin, making it an unsuitable option for this patient.\r\n\r\nC. Levonorgestrel 3 mg orally as soon as possible\r\n\r\nA double dose of levonorgestrel may be considered in patients using enzyme-inducing medications, but this approach is less effective than using a copper IUD and is not the preferred method in this scenario.\r\n\r\nD. Mifepristone 10 mg orally as soon as possible\r\n\r\nMifepristone is not licensed for emergency contraception in the UK. Its use in this context is not supported by guidelines or clinical practice.\r\n\r\nE. Ulipristal acetate 30 mg orally as soon as possible\r\n\r\nUlipristal acetate is a commonly used emergency contraceptive. However, its efficacy is reduced in patients on enzyme-inducing medications like rifampicin, making it unsuitable for this patient.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, a copper IUD is the preferred option for emergency contraception in patients on enzyme-inducing medications due to its unaffected efficacy. Hormonal options, even at adjusted doses, are less reliable in such scenarios.

    "why": "A. Take the last pill she missed and continue the pack as normal. Use condoms for the next 7 days and start a new pack without a break.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWhen two or more combined oral contraceptive (COC) pills are missed in the third week of the pack, the hormone-free interval must be avoided to maintain contraceptive efficacy. The woman should take the last missed pill immediately, continue the pack as normal, and start a new pack without a break. Additionally, extra contraception, such as condoms, is needed for the next 7 days. Emergency contraception is not required unless additional pills were missed earlier in the same or previous cycle.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Take the last pill she missed and continue the pack as normal. Use condoms for the next 7 days and take a 7-day break before starting a new pack.\r\n\r\nTaking a 7-day break after missing two pills in the third week increases the risk of ovulation, as this extends the hormone-free interval. This option is not recommended.\r\n\r\nC. Take the last pill she missed and discard the rest of the pack. Use condoms for the next 7 days and start a new pack immediately.\r\n\r\nDiscarding the remaining pills is unnecessary. Continuation of the current pack ensures consistent hormone levels and prevents contraceptive failure.\r\n\r\nD. Take the last pill she missed and discard the rest of the pack. Use emergency contraception as soon as possible and start a new pack immediately.\r\n\r\nEmergency contraception is not required in this scenario as the pills were missed in the third week and the proper steps (continuing the pack and using additional contraception) mitigate the risk of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nE. Take both pills she missed and continue the pack as normal. Use emergency contraception as soon as possible and take a 7-day break before starting a new pack.\r\n\r\nTaking both missed pills is not recommended, as this provides no additional benefit. A 7-day break is also inappropriate, as it increases the risk of ovulation and potential contraceptive failure.\r\n\r\nNICE guidance for managing missed COC pills aligns with the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) recommendations. If two or more pills are missed in week 3, patients should skip the hormone-free interval and begin a new pack immediately after finishing the current one. Additional contraception should be used for 7 days, but emergency contraception is only necessary if pills were also missed earlier in the cycle.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "B: Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) within 5 days of UPSI\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception (EC), with a failure rate of less than 1%. It works by preventing fertilisation and implantation and can be inserted up to:\r\n\r\n120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI), or Up to 5 days after ovulation, whichever is later.\r\nThis patient had UPSI on Friday night and has presented on Monday morning, which is exactly 3 days (72 hours) later. Since she is still within 5 days, the Cu-IUD remains the most suitable and effective option. Additionally, if she chooses to keep it, it can provide ongoing contraception for up to 5\u201310 years.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Combined oral contraceptive pill for 21 days\r\n\r\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill (COC) is not licensed for emergency contraception.\r\nIt is used for regular contraception and requires consistent daily use to be effective.\r\n\r\nC: Desogestrel 75 micrograms daily for 14 days\r\n\r\nDesogestrel is a progestogen-only pill (POP), designed for continuous contraception, not emergency use.\r\nIt does not work as an emergency contraceptive method.\r\n\r\nD: Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg as soon as possible\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel (LNG) is licensed for use within 72 hours (3 days) of UPSI.\r\nThis patient is exactly at 72 hours (Monday morning after Friday night), so levonorgestrel is still an option.\r\nHowever, Cu-IUD is more effective, and LNG effectiveness declines closer to ovulation.\r\n\r\nE: Ulipristal acetate 30 mg as soon as possible\r\n\r\nUlipristal acetate (ellaOne) can be used within 120 hours (5 days) of UPSI.\r\nIt is more effective than levonorgestrel, particularly closer to ovulation.\r\nHowever, Cu-IUD is still the first-line choice due to its superior efficacy.\r\n\r\nEmergency Contraception (EC) \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025) and BNF recommendations, the choice of emergency contraception depends on timing, effectiveness, and patient-specific factors:\r\n\r\nFirst-line choice: Copper IUD (most effective, non-hormonal, long-term option).\r\n\r\nIf Cu-IUD is declined or unavailable:\r\n\r\nUlipristal acetate (most effective hormonal option, effective up to 120 hours).\r\nLevonorgestrel (less effective, only within 72 hours).\r\n\r\nFactors affecting choice:\r\n\r\nBMI > 26 or weight > 70kg: Double-dose levonorgestrel or consider Cu-IUD.\r\nBreastfeeding: Levonorgestrel preferred over ulipristal.\r\nDrug interactions: Enzyme inducers reduce effectiveness of oral EC.\r\n\r\nFollow-up care should include:\r\n\r\nSTI screening if appropriate.\r\nDiscussion of regular contraception options to prevent future UPSI.\r\nPregnancy test in 3 weeks if menstruation is delayed.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: E) A LABA, a LAMA, and an ICS\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the GOLD ABCD assessment tool, this patient falls into Group D:\r\n\r\n* High symptoms: CAT \u226510, mMRC \u22652\r\n* High exacerbation risk: \u22652 moderate exacerbations or \u22651 hospitalisation in the past year\r\n* Elevated eosinophil count: 421 cells/\u00b5L (which supports the use of ICS)\r\n\r\nFor Group D patients, the first-line treatment involves a combination of a LABA, LAMA, and ICS to manage symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and improve quality of life. The elevated eosinophil count supports the use of ICS to help reduce inflammation in the lungs.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) A short-acting bronchodilator as needed \u2013 Incorrect. While useful for symptom relief, this is insufficient for Group D patients who require more intensive treatment to manage both symptoms and exacerbations.\r\n\r\nB) A LAMA and ICS \u2013 Incorrect. While this combination is beneficial for some patients, Group D patients need both a LABA and LAMA for optimal management in addition to an ICS, as per GOLD guidelines.\r\n\r\nC) A LABA and a LAMA \u2013 Incorrect. A LABA and LAMA combination is appropriate for Group C, but Group D requires the addition of an ICS due to the higher exacerbation risk and eosinophil count.\r\n\r\nD) A LABA and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. This combination alone is often insufficient for Group D, where a LAMA is also required for better symptom control and exacerbation prevention.\r\n\r\nF) Azithromycin \u2013 Incorrect. Azithromycin is recommended for patients with frequent exacerbations who are smoking or have significant chronic bronchitis, but not as first-line therapy for Group D.\r\n\r\nG) Carbocisteine \u2013 Incorrect. Mucolytics like carbocisteine may be considered in some cases, but they are not first-line therapy for Group D patients who require dual bronchodilation and ICS.\r\n\r\nH) Theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. Theophylline has limited efficacy and is not recommended as a first-line therapy for COPD patients, especially those in Group D.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 45-year-old woman with urge incontinence is taking darifenacin and rifampicin.",
    "why": "E. Decreased efficacy of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nRifampicin is a potent enzyme inducer, particularly of the CYP3A4 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including darifenacin. When rifampicin is taken concurrently with darifenacin, it can increase the metabolism and clearance of darifenacin, reducing its blood levels and efficacy. This interaction may result in decreased effectiveness of darifenacin in treating urge incontinence.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Increased risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nThis interaction is not typically associated with rifampicin and darifenacin. Rifampicin does not significantly affect coagulation pathways, and darifenacin is not known to have a direct impact on bleeding risks.\r\n\r\nB. Increased levels of Darifenacin\r\n\r\nRifampicin is known to induce CYP3A4, which leads to faster metabolism and lower levels of drugs metabolised by this enzyme, such as darifenacin. Therefore, increased levels of darifenacin are unlikely with concurrent use of rifampicin.\r\n\r\nC. Increased antimuscarinic side effects\r\n\r\nRifampicin does not have a direct effect on increasing the antimuscarinic side effects of darifenacin. In fact, the decreased efficacy of darifenacin may reduce its intended antimuscarinic effects.\r\n\r\nD. Decreased absorption of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nRifampicin does not affect the absorption of darifenacin. The primary interaction occurs at the level of drug metabolism via the CYP3A4 enzyme, not at the site of absorption.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, drug interactions such as those between rifampicin and darifenacin should be carefully considered. Rifampicin\u2019s enzyme-inducing properties can reduce the efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, necessitating dose adjustments or alternative treatments. In this case, the reduced efficacy of darifenacin should be monitored, and an alternative therapy for urge incontinence might need to be considered.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 23-year-old woman presents to your community pharmacy after a recent diagnosis of asthma by her GP. She has been prescribed a salbutamol inhaler and is awaiting a review for possible preventer therapy. She is worried about potential triggers for her asthma symptoms, as she has already experienced two episodes of wheezing and chest tightness over the past month, one after jogging outdoors, and another while visiting a friend who owns a cat.\r\n\r\nShe asks are there things I should be avoiding to help manage my asthma better?",
    "why": "Correct Answer: B) Antihistamines\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\u2028Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by a variety of environmental, physical, and immunological factors. These include:\r\n* Air pollution \u2013 e.g. nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter\r\n* Allergens \u2013 e.g. pollen, pet dander, house dust mites\r\n* Exercise \u2013 particularly in cold, dry environments\r\n* Viral respiratory infections \u2013 such as rhinovirus or influenza\r\n\r\nHowever, antihistamines are not a trigger for asthma. On the contrary, they are often used to manage comorbid allergic rhinitis, which can worsen asthma control if left untreated. Antihistamines block histamine receptors, reducing allergic symptoms and potentially aiding in better overall asthma management.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Options:\r\n\r\nA) Air pollution \u2013 Correctly identified as a trigger. It increases airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity.\r\n\r\nC) Allergens \u2013 Common triggers. Many asthma patients are sensitised to airborne allergens.\r\n\r\nD) Exercise \u2013 Can induce bronchoconstriction, especially if asthma is poorly controlled.\r\n\r\nE) Viral infections \u2013 One of the most common causes of acute exacerbations, particularly in younger patients.\r\n\r\nKey Point:\r\n\u2028While many environmental and physiological stimuli can exacerbate asthma, antihistamines are not one of them. In fact, managing comorbid allergic conditions with antihistamines is a key part of optimal asthma control.\r\n\r\nBonus Tip for Practice:\r\nWhen counselling newly diagnosed patients, advise them to:\r\n* Monitor their peak flow\r\n* Track symptom patterns\r\n* Identify and avoid known triggers (e.g. pets, pollen, smoke)\r\n* Understand the difference between AIR and MART therapy\r\n\r\nFor further review on asthma management and counselling points, visit:\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Over the past year, he has experienced frequent exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and antibiotics. He has been using a combination inhaler containing a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), but he continues to report breathlessness, cough, and sputum production.\r\n\r\nHe also uses a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) more than four times per week. His spirometry shows an FEV1 of 40% predicted, and his COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score is 22. He has no other medical conditions or allergies. Treatment decisions will follow NICE COPD guidelines.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: B) Azithromycin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, people with COPD who experience frequent exacerbations (should be considered for long-term prophylactic antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the patient meets the criteria due to ongoing symptoms and repeated exacerbations despite dual inhaler therapy. The first-line option for preventing further exacerbations is azithromycin, due to its anti-inflammatory properties and relatively favourable side effect profile. Erythromycin is also an option, but azithromycin is more commonly used.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) Amoxicillin \u2013 Incorrect. This is often used for acute COPD exacerbations, but it is not recommended as a long-term prophylactic antibiotic.\r\n\r\n\r\nC) Clarithromycin \u2013 Incorrect. While it is a macrolide, it is not preferred in long-term use due to a less favourable interaction and side effect profile compared to azithromycin.\r\n\r\nD) Doxycycline \u2013 Incorrect. Like amoxicillin, doxycycline is used for acute management of exacerbations, not for preventive long-term use.\r\n\r\nE) No antibiotic \u2013 Incorrect. Given the frequency of this patient\u2019s exacerbations and ongoing symptoms, long-term prophylactic antibiotics are indicated.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* NICE recommends azithromycin (or erythromycin) as long-term prophylaxis for patients with exacerbations despite inhaled therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: D) Wash the spacer device once a month with mild detergent, do not rinse, and air-dry without wiping\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nAccording to the BNF, spacer devices should be cleaned once a month with mild detergent and allowed to air-dry without wiping. This prevents the build-up of static charge that can cause medication to cling to the sides, ensuring more effective delivery of the inhaler medication.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) Do not wash the spacer device, but wipe it with alcohol wipes before and after each use: Not recommended. Cleaning with alcohol wipes is not the appropriate method and does not prevent static build-up.\r\n\r\nB) Do not wash the spacer device, but replace it with a new one every month: Replacement every month is unnecessary. Proper cleaning is more effective and economical.\r\n\r\nC) Wash the spacer device once a week with hot water and soap, rinse well, and dry with a cloth: Weekly washing is too frequent and could cause damage or static build-up if dried with a cloth.\r\n\r\nE) Wash the spacer device once every three months with vinegar and water, rinse well, and dry with a hairdryer: Infrequent cleaning and drying with a hairdryer are not recommended.

NICE and BNF guidance recommend regular full blood count monitoring for patients on sulfasalazine due to this risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Folic acid deficiency\r\n\r\nmay cause anaemia and mouth sores, but does not typically cause bruising or pancytopenia\r\n\r\nC) Hemolytic anaemia\r\n\r\nwould cause fatigue and possibly jaundice, but not bruising or infections\r\n\r\nD) Iron deficiency anaemia\r\n\r\ncauses fatigue and pallor but does not explain bruising, infections, or bleeding gums\r\n\r\nE) Vitamin B12 deficiency\r\n\r\ncauses macrocytic anaemia and neurological symptoms, less likely to cause low platelets or white cells\r\n\r\n\r\nSulfasalazine is a DMARD that can rarely cause aplastic anaemia, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent medical assessment. Patients should be counselled to report symptoms such as persistent sore throat, bruising, bleeding, or infections, and regular blood monitoring is essential during treatment.",

    "text": "A 10-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis (CF) presents to the respiratory clinic for a routine review. He has been using dornase alfa via nebuliser for the past year as part of his mucolytic therapy. Despite this, he experiences frequent coughing, sputum production, and recurrent chest infections\r\n.\r\nHe also uses salbutamol as a reliever up to five times per week, particularly before physiotherapy. His forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\u2081) is 60% of predicted, and his BMI is 16, suggesting he is underweight. He has no other medical conditions or allergies.\r\n\r\nYou are asked to recommend the most appropriate step-up treatment for managing his respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\n[![question-bank-2198.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Dy3Zcz1J/question-bank-2198.png)](https://postimg.cc/0rZPkPWP)",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\u2028B) Add a hypertonic sodium chloride inhaler\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\u2028The NICE guidelines recommend considering hypertonic sodium chloride inhalation as an add-on mucolytic therapy in children and young people with cystic fibrosis who continue to experience symptoms despite dornase alfa.\r\n\r\nHypertonic saline works by drawing water into the airway, thereby hydrating mucus. This can help reduce sputum viscosity and improve lung function, particularly in those with ongoing productive cough and frequent infections.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) Add Carbocisteine \u2013 Incorrect. Although carbocisteine is a mucolytic used in chronic respiratory conditions like COPD, it is not routinely recommended in CF and has limited evidence in children with CF.\r\n\r\nC) Add a mannitol dry powder inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. Mannitol is another osmotic agent, but it is licensed only for adults (\u226518 years) with CF and is generally reserved when other treatments are not tolerated or ineffective.\r\n\r\nD) Add lumacaftor with ivacaftor tablets \u2013 Incorrect. This CFTR modulator therapy is gene-specific (e.g., for F508del homozygous patients). It should only be used in eligible patients based on genotype testing, not empirically as a step-up mucolytic.\r\n\r\nE) Increase the dose of dornase alfa \u2013 Incorrect. Dornase alfa is generally prescribed once daily, and increasing frequency is not supported unless under specialist supervision and clear clinical benefit has been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "E) 1000 mg/m\u00b2 every 4 weeks\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the SmPC for cyclophosphamide in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, the recommended dose is typically 500 mg/m\u00b2 to 1000 mg/m\u00b2 body surface area per month. For severe extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, the higher dose of 1000 mg/m\u00b2 every 4 weeks is commonly used. This dosing schedule helps manage the severity of disease in patients who have not responded to conventional therapies.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) 60 mg/kg for 2 days: This dosing regimen is not typically used for autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Such a high dose for 2 days would be more suitable for some cancer treatments but not for the chronic management of rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\nB) 100 mg/m\u00b2 daily: This is not an appropriate dose for rheumatoid arthritis. Chronic dosing with cyclophosphamide is usually given monthly, not daily, due to the potential for significant toxicity.\r\n\r\nC) 500 mg/m\u00b2 every 2 weeks: While 500 mg/m\u00b2 is within the correct range, the regimen of every 2 weeks would generally be used for more aggressive treatments (such as some cancer therapies) rather than for autoimmune diseases.\r\n\r\nD) 750 mg/m\u00b2 every 3 weeks: This dose is not typically recommended for autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. The standard regimen is usually either 500 mg/m\u00b2 or 1000 mg/m\u00b2 per month, with monthly dosing.\r\n\r\nFollowing NICE guidelines and the SmPC for cyclophosphamide, the appropriate dosing schedule for a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and severe extra-articular manifestations is 1000 mg/m\u00b2 every 4 weeks.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "Mirabegron\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient has symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB), characterised by urinary urgency and urge incontinence, despite non-pharmacological interventions such as pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle modifications. According to NICE NG123 and the BNF, mirabegron is the most appropriate first-line pharmacological treatment for her condition because:\r\n\r\nMyasthenia gravis is a contraindication to anticholinergic medications like oxybutynin and darifenacin, as they can exacerbate muscle weakness.\r\nMirabegron, a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist, relaxes the detrusor muscle without anticholinergic activity, making it safe and effective in this patient.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Darifenacin\r\n\r\nDarifenacin is an anticholinergic medication that could be used first-line for overactive bladder. However, it is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis because it may worsen muscle weakness and exacerbate the condition.\r\n\r\nB: Desmopressin\r\n\r\nDesmopressin is used to treat nocturnal enuresis or diabetes insipidus and is not indicated for managing overactive bladder.\r\n\r\nC: Duloxetine hydrochloride\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is used for stress urinary incontinence, not for overactive bladder. The patient\u2019s symptoms, such as urgency and urge incontinence, align with OAB rather than stress incontinence.\r\n\r\nE: Oxybutynin hydrochloride\r\n\r\nOxybutynin is an anticholinergic commonly used for OAB. However, it is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening neuromuscular symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe NICE NG123 guidelines recommend starting pharmacological treatment for overactive bladder in patients who have not responded to non-pharmacological measures like pelvic floor exercises and lifestyle modifications. First-line options include anticholinergics (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine, or darifenacin) or mirabegron. In patients where anticholinergics are contraindicated or not tolerated, mirabegron is the recommended alternative. Mirabegron works by relaxing the detrusor muscle without the side effects associated with anticholinergic medications, making it particularly suitable for patients with conditions like myasthenia gravis. Regular follow-up is essential to monitor treatment effectiveness and manage any adverse effects.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nB) Diarrhoea\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe combination of fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin is standard in the treatment of colorectal cancer (e.g. FOLFOX regimen). Fluorouracil, in particular, is known for causing gastrointestinal mucosal toxicity, leading to diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, and in some cases, bloody stools due to mucosal irritation or colitis. This side effect can be dose-limiting and requires careful monitoring, especially to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Constipation \u2013 More likely with vinca alkaloids or opioid analgesics, not fluoropyrimidines\r\n\r\nC) Fatigue \u2013 Common but non-specific; doesn\u2019t explain diarrhoea and GI cramping\r\n\r\nD) Hair loss \u2013 Possible with oxaliplatin but not linked to GI symptoms\r\n\r\nE) Infection \u2013 Would require evidence of neutropenia or fever\r\n\r\nF) Mouth sores \u2013 Also seen with 5-FU but no oral symptoms described\r\n\r\nG) Nausea and vomiting \u2013 Common with many agents, but not the key symptom cluster here\r\n\r\nH) Neuropathy \u2013 Caused by oxaliplatin but presents with tingling/numbness, not diarrhoea\r\n\r\nChemotherapy-induced diarrhoea (CID) is a significant and potentially serious complication, particularly associated with fluoropyrimidines such as fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine. These agents damage rapidly dividing epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to mucosal atrophy, inflammation, and impaired water absorption. \r\nNICE and BNF emphasise the importance of early recognition and management of CID, especially when accompanied by blood in the stool, which may suggest chemotherapy-induced colitis. \r\nSevere diarrhoea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and may require hospitalisation, dose reduction, or temporary cessation of chemotherapy. \r\nAntidiarrhoeal agents like loperamide are commonly used, and stool monitoring is essential to rule out infection or C. difficile, particularly in hospital settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 50-year-old man with lung cancer who has been receiving cisplatin and etoposide for 3 cycles. He complains of tingling and numbness in his fingers and toes, and difficulty picking up small objects.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nH) Neuropathy\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy agent, is well known for its dose-dependent neurotoxicity, often resulting in peripheral neuropathy. This presents as tingling, numbness, or burning sensations in the extremities and can affect fine motor skills, such as picking up small objects. Although etoposide is more associated with myelosuppression and mucositis, cisplatin is the primary contributor to the patient's neurological symptoms.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Constipation \u2013 More common with vinca alkaloids or opioid use\r\n\r\nB) Diarrhoea \u2013 More typical with irinotecan or fluoropyrimidines\r\n\r\nC) Fatigue \u2013 Very common in chemotherapy, but not specific to this clinical presentation\r\n\r\nD) Hair loss \u2013 Can occur with etoposide, but unrelated to sensory symptoms\r\n\r\nE) Infection \u2013 Would typically include fever or other systemic signs\r\n\r\nF) Mouth sores \u2013 Suggest mucositis; no oral complaints were reported\r\n\r\nG) Nausea and vomiting \u2013 Common with cisplatin, but not the issue here\r\n\r\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a recognised and potentially long-term adverse effect of agents such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and vincristine. The symptoms often begin in a \u201cglove and stocking\u201d distribution and may be sensory, motor, or autonomic in nature. NICE guidance and BNF Chapter 8 highlight that neurotoxicity is cumulative, and may necessitate dose adjustments, treatment delays, or discontinuation if it interferes with daily activities. Importantly, patients may not report these symptoms unless specifically asked, so regular assessment for signs of neuropathy is essential during chemotherapy. Preventive options are limited, and management is typically supportive, involving physiotherapy and neuropathic pain relief (e.g. duloxetine or amitriptyline).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant disease and Immunosupression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has no history of bowel disease or obstruction. Her current medications include omeprazole, simvastatin, and oral contraceptive pill.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE) Tramadol\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Tramadol is an opioid analgesic. Like other opioids, it reduces gastrointestinal motility by acting on \u03bc-opioid receptors in the gut wall, leading to delayed intestinal transit time and increased water reabsorption in the colon. This causes the stools to become hard and dry, resulting in opioid-induced constipation.\r\n\r\n- This is a well-recognised class effect of opioids, and tramadol is no exception, especially when taken regularly and at higher doses, as in this case. It is more constipating than paracetamol or NSAIDs and is more likely to be the cause here.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Ibuprofen\r\n\r\nNot commonly associated with constipation. It can cause GI irritation or ulcers but does not typically slow bowel motility.\r\n\r\nB) Omeprazole\r\n\r\nGenerally not linked with constipation. GI upset may occur, but diarrhoea is more common than constipation.\r\n\r\nC) Paracetamol\r\n\r\nHas no significant effect on gut motility and is not known to cause constipation.\r\n\r\nD) Simvastatin\r\n\r\nMild GI upset is listed as a possible side effect, but constipation is uncommon and would not explain this presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Opioid analgesics such as tramadol, codeine, and morphine frequently cause constipation by slowing bowel motility and increasing fluid reabsorption. This is known as opioid-induced constipation (OIC).\r\nProphylactic laxatives are often advised for patients on regular opioid therapy, particularly if taken long-term or at higher doses.\r\n\r\n- First-line options for managing OIC include stimulant laxatives (e.g. senna) or combination products with stool softeners.",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Ibuprofen and Sertraline\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- The combination of NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) and SSRIs (like sertraline) significantly increases the risk of upper GI bleeding.\r\n\r\n- Ibuprofen, an NSAID, causes direct irritation to the gastric mucosa and inhibits COX-1, reducing the production of protective prostaglandins in the stomach lining.\r\n\r\n- Sertraline, an SSRI, impairs platelet aggregation by depleting serotonin in platelets, further raising the bleeding risk.\r\n\r\n- The synergistic effect of these two drugs greatly enhances the likelihood of a bleeding ulcer or erosion, especially in older patients and those on long-term therapy.\r\n\r\n- This is a well-documented interaction in both the BNF and clinical guidance on polypharmacy in the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Amlodipine\r\n\r\nNot associated with upper GI bleeding.

    "text": "A 60-year-old woman with urge incontinence is taking oxybutynin and ketoconazole.",
    "why": "Increased antimuscarinic side effects\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nKetoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for metabolising oxybutynin. Concurrent use of ketoconazole with oxybutynin can lead to increased plasma concentrations of oxybutynin, which, in turn, increases the risk of antimuscarinic side effects. These side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention, and in severe cases, confusion or cognitive impairment, particularly in older patients.\r\n\r\nThis interaction highlights the importance of monitoring for antimuscarinic side effects when prescribing or dispensing these medications together. Dose adjustment of oxybutynin or the use of an alternative medication may be considered if significant side effects occur.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Increased risk of bleeding\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because neither oxybutynin nor ketoconazole is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and there is no interaction between these drugs that would lead to this effect.\r\n\r\nB: Increased risk of QT prolongation\r\n\r\nAlthough ketoconazole can increase the risk of QT prolongation, this is not the primary concern in its interaction with oxybutynin. Oxybutynin is not typically associated with significant QT prolongation at therapeutic doses.\r\n\r\nD: Decreased absorption of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because ketoconazole does not reduce the absorption of oxybutynin. Instead, it increases its plasma levels by inhibiting its metabolism via CYP3A4.\r\n\r\nE: Decreased efficacy of antimuscarinics\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because the interaction between ketoconazole and oxybutynin increases, rather than decreases, oxybutynin\u2019s efficacy and side effects.\r\n\r\nOxybutynin, an antimuscarinic used for urge incontinence, is metabolised by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver. According to NICE NG123 and the BNF, concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, or erythromycin) can increase oxybutynin plasma concentrations, thereby heightening the risk of antimuscarinic side effects. These include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and urinary retention, which may significantly impair quality of life, especially in older adults.\r\n\r\nWhen prescribing or dispensing oxybutynin alongside CYP3A4 inhibitors, healthcare providers should:\r\n\r\nMonitor for increased side effects.\r\nConsider reducing the oxybutynin dose if side effects become problematic.\r\nExplore alternative medications if the interaction leads to intolerable side effects.\r\nThis proactive management ensures patient safety and optimises treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Intrathecal\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nVincristine, a vinca alkaloid used in chemotherapy, must never be administered intrathecally (into the spine), as this is fatal. Intrathecal administration of vincristine causes severe neurotoxicity, leading to irreversible paralysis and death. This risk is well-documented, and strict protocols are in place to prevent accidental intrathecal administration.\r\n\r\nVincristine is specifically administered intravenously (IV), and care is taken to label it clearly and handle it appropriately to avoid route errors. The oncology team should always ensure that intrathecal medications are prepared and stored separately from intravenous chemotherapy to minimise the risk of such errors.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Intramuscular\r\n\r\nVincristine is not administered intramuscularly, but this route is not associated with fatal toxicity.\r\n\r\nC: Intravenous\r\n\r\nIntravenous administration is the correct and safe route for vincristine.

According to NICE guidelines and the BNF, vincristine is administered intravenously only, and strict safeguards are in place to prevent intrathecal administration, which is fatal. Healthcare professionals must ensure that vincristine is stored, prepared, and administered in line with safety protocols, including:\r\n\r\nClearly labelling vincristine as \u201cFor Intravenous Use Only\u201d.\r\nSeparating intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy drugs in storage and during preparation.\r\nFollowing standard operating procedures to verify the correct route before administration.\r\nPatients receiving vincristine should also be monitored for other potential side effects, such as peripheral neuropathy, which is a dose-limiting toxicity of vinca alkaloids.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant Disease and Immunosuppression System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She confirms that she had intercourse within the past 72 hours and is confident that this was during the preovulatory phase of her cycle. Upon questioning you find that her last period was normal, that she is on no other regular medication, and that she has taken the pill three times before over the past 6 weeks.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Supply the morning-after-pill and recommend that the patient speaks to her practice nurse about contraception\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe NICE guidelines and Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guidelines support the supply of emergency contraception (EC) to all eligible individuals, including those under 18 years old. The fact that this patient is 16 years old, competent to consent, and has had unprotected intercourse within the past 72 hours makes her eligible for emergency contraception.\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute restriction on repeated use of emergency contraception within the same menstrual cycle; however, repeated use suggests a need for further contraceptive counselling. Levonorgestrel (LNG) and ulipristal acetate (UPA) are both licensed options for EC, with UPA preferred if the patient is in the preovulatory phase, as it is more effective at delaying ovulation.\r\n\r\nDue to her frequent use of emergency contraception in the past six weeks, she would benefit from a discussion about long-term contraceptive options, which is why referring her to a practice nurse or sexual health clinic is recommended.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Do not supply the morning-after-pill as it is not licensed for use in those who have used it previously in the last cycle\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because repeated use of emergency contraception within the same cycle is not contraindicated. While frequent use is not ideal, it does not prevent another supply if needed.\r\n\r\nB) Explain that you cannot sell the morning-after-pill as she is under 18 and the product is not licensed for her age group\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate are both licensed for emergency contraception in those under 18 years old. A pharmacist can provide EC to a competent minor.\r\n\r\nC) Refuse to supply the morning-after-pill as it is against your conscience and provide no further advice to the patient.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect and would be a breach of professional duty. Pharmacists may exercise their right to conscientious objection, but they must refer the patient to another provider to ensure timely access to EC. Denying access without referral would be unethical and unprofessional.\r\n\r\nE) Supply the morning-after-pill and advise her that she is at risk of more severe side effects as it is her fourth supply in the past 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because there is no strong evidence that repeated use of emergency contraception increases the risk of severe side effects. However, it does suggest that regular contraception is needed, which is why a discussion about ongoing contraceptive options is important.\r\n\r\nEmergency Contraception and Counselling:\r\n\r\nEmergency contraception (EC) should be offered to any patient at risk of unintended pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI). Repeated use within the same cycle is not a contraindication, but it highlights the need for more reliable contraception.\r\n\r\nKey considerations for emergency contraception:\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel 1.5 mg or 3 mg (LNG-EC) is licensed up to 72 hours after UPSI, with a second dose needed if the patient vomits within 3 hours.\r\nUlipristal acetate 30 mg (UPA-EC) is effective up to 120 hours post-UPSI and should be considered first-line if the patient is in the preovulatory phase, as it prevents ovulation more effectively than LNG-EC.\r\nCopper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is the most effective form of EC and can be used up to 5 days post-UPSI. It also provides ongoing contraception.\r\nRepeated EC use within the same cycle is not restricted, but frequent use suggests the need for further contraceptive counselling.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 7 (Obs, Gynae and Urinary Tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She says she forgot to take her pill yesterday morning and hasn't had unprotected sex with her partner. She wants to know if she needs to do anything to prevent pregnancy.",
    "why": "Take the missed pill as soon as possible and continue the pack as normal. Use condoms for the next 2 days.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe desogestrel progestogen-only pill (POP) must be taken at the same time each day. If a pill is taken more than 12 hours late, contraceptive protection may be reduced. In this case, the woman should:\r\n\r\nTake the missed pill as soon as possible, even if it means taking two pills on the same day.\r\nContinue taking the remaining pills at the usual time.\r\nUse additional contraception (e.g., condoms) for the next 2 days until full contraceptive protection is re-established.\r\nSince she hasn't had unprotected sex, emergency contraception is not required.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Take the missed pill as soon as possible and continue the pack as normal. Use condoms for the next 7 days.\r\n\r\nCondoms are only required for 2 days after a missed pill when taking the desogestrel POP, not 7 days. This advice is excessive.\r\n\r\nC. Take the missed pill as soon as possible and discard the rest of the pack. Use condoms for the next 7 days and start a new pack immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to discard the rest of the pack or start a new one. The correct action is to continue the current pack as normal.\r\n\r\nD. Take the missed pill as soon as possible and discard the rest of the pack. Use emergency contraception as soon as possible and start a new pack immediately.\r\n\r\nEmergency contraception is not required because she has not had unprotected sex. Discarding the pack is also unnecessary.\r\n\r\nE. Take two pills today and continue the pack as normal. Use emergency contraception as soon as possible and take a 7-day break before starting a new pack.\r\n\r\nTaking two pills is not required unless one was missed and the next pill is due at the same time. The POP regimen does not involve 7-day breaks, and emergency contraception is unnecessary in this scenario.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH):\r\n\r\nMissed POP Guidance:\r\n\r\nIf a pill is taken less than 12 hours late, contraceptive protection is maintained.\r\n\r\nIf a pill is taken more than 12 hours late, additional contraception is needed for 2 days.\r\n\r\nEmergency Contraception:\r\n\r\nRecommended only if unprotected sex occurred in the 2 days after a missed pill.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes on Progestogen-Only Pills:\r\n\r\nDesogestrel POP: Offers a 12-hour window for taking the pill compared to traditional POPs, which have a 3-hour window.\r\n\r\nCommon side effects include irregular bleeding, headaches, and breast tenderness.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF Chapter 7 (Contraception):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: Prednisolone can be taken during pregnancy, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk.\r\n\r\nRationale:\u2028The use of prednisolone during pregnancy is generally considered safe when the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks. In cases of severe asthma, poorly controlled symptoms can pose significant risks to both the mother and the fetus. Prednisolone is often necessary to manage severe inflammation and prevent complications such as hypoxia. According to guidance from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), there is no convincing evidence that systemic corticosteroids, including prednisolone, increase the incidence of congenital abnormalities when used appropriately during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Incorrect \u2013 Prednisolone is not contraindicated during pregnancy. There is no strong evidence of a high risk of fetal abnormalities when used appropriately.\r\n\r\nB) Incorrect \u2013 There is no recommendation to avoid prednisolone specifically during the first trimester. In fact, withholding treatment could increase risks associated with poorly controlled asthma.\r\n\r\nD) Incorrect \u2013 While corticosteroids have historically been linked with cleft lip or palate, there is no conclusive evidence to support a significant increase in risk with prednisolone use.\r\n\r\nE) Incorrect \u2013 There is no evidence to suggest that prednisolone should only be used during the third trimester. It can be used at any point in pregnancy if clinically needed.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n* Prednisolone is not contraindicated in pregnancy.\r\n* Effective asthma control is essential during pregnancy.\r\n* No strong evidence links short-term corticosteroid use to congenital abnormalities.\r\n* Prolonged or repeated use may increase the risk of intrauterine growth restriction, but this is rare and usually not clinically significant.\r\n* Benefits of prednisolone in managing severe asthma outweigh potential risks.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nA) Antacids or alginates as required\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- According to BNF and NICE NG1: Antenatal care, initial treatment for dyspepsia in pregnancy should include lifestyle and dietary advice. If symptoms persist, antacids or alginates are recommended as first-line pharmacological options. These are considered safe in pregnancy, effective for mild to moderate symptoms, and available OTC.\r\n\r\n- Antacids neutralise gastric acid, and alginates form a gel-like raft to reduce acid reflux into the oesophagus.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Famotidine 20 mg twice daily\r\n\r\nFamotidine is an H2-receptor antagonist. It may be considered after antacids or alginates and if symptoms persist despite initial treatment. It is not first-line in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nC) Misoprostol 200 micrograms four times daily\r\n\r\nMisoprostol is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can induce uterine contractions and lead to miscarriage or premature labour. It is never appropriate for dyspepsia in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nD) Omeprazole 20 mg once daily\r\n\r\nPPIs like omeprazole are reserved for refractory symptoms when antacids or H2RAs have failed. Although considered relatively safe in pregnancy, they are not first-line unless other measures are ineffective.\r\n\r\nE) Sucralfate 1 g four times daily\r\n\r\nSucralfate is not routinely used in pregnancy in the UK and is not first-line. It may also affect absorption of other medications and requires frequent dosing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor dyspepsia in pregnancy:\r\n\r\n- First-line: Lifestyle and dietary modification\r\n\r\n- If needed: Antacids or alginates (safe, OTC options)\r\n\r\n- Escalate to H2RAs (e.g. ranitidine, famotidine) or PPIs only if symptoms persist despite antacids\r\n\r\n- Avoid misoprostol due to abortifacient effects",

She denies recent exacerbations or hospitalisations but says the persistent mucus and cough are affecting her daily quality of life. Her FEV1 is 35% of predicted and she is otherwise fit and well, with no history of allergies or significant comorbidities.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: D) Carbocisteine 2250 mg daily in divided doses\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the NICE guidelines, mucolytic therapy should be considered for people with COPD who have a chronic cough productive of sputum. This patient fits the criteria based on persistent symptoms and high CAT score. Mucolytics should be trialled and continued if symptomatic improvement is seen.\r\n\r\nWhile NICE does not specify a particular agent or dose, the BNF provides dosing guidance:\r\n\r\n* Carbocisteine is the preferred mucolytic here, with a starting dose of 2250 mg daily in divided doses, which may later be reduced to 1500 mg daily once symptoms improve.\r\n* Acetylcysteine is also licensed but typically prescribed at 600 mg once daily, making the given acetylcysteine options inappropriate based on BNF recommendations.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) Acetylcysteine 600 mg three times daily\u2028This dose is higher than the licensed recommendation (600 mg once daily) and not commonly used in COPD in the UK.\r\n\r\nB) Acetylcysteine 1200 mg twice daily\u2028Also exceeds the licensed UK dose for COPD. It is not supported by NICE or BNF guidance for this indication.\r\n\r\nC) Carbocisteine 1500 mg daily in divided doses\u2028This is the maintenance dose, but not the appropriate starting dose. For symptom control, 2250 mg should be tried initially.\r\n\r\nE) No mucolytic agent needed\u2028This would be inappropriate given her ongoing productive cough and high CAT score, both of which indicate the need for symptom-targeted therapy.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* Mucolytics should be trialled in COPD patients with chronic productive cough.\r\n* Carbocisteine is the first-line oral mucolytic, started at 2250 mg/day.\r\n* Therapy should be reviewed and stopped if no benefit is seen.\r\n* NICE refers to BNF for dosing information.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: A) Hypokalaemia due to high doses of salbutamol\r\n\r\nRationale:\u2028Salbutamol, especially when administered in high doses via nebulisation, can cause hypokalaemia. This electrolyte disturbance often presents with muscle cramps, tremors, palpitations, and arrhythmias, particularly in children with acute severe asthma who may receive repeated or continuous doses of salbutamol.\r\n\r\nWhile magnesium sulfate and ipratropium bromide are part of evidence-based acute asthma treatment, neither are associated with significant disturbances in potassium, calcium, or sodium levels at standard doses used in paediatric emergency care.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Hyperkalaemia due to magnesium sulfate \u2013 Incorrect. Magnesium sulfate does not cause hyperkalaemia. It may be given to stabilise the myocardium in severe asthma but doesn\u2019t significantly alter potassium levels.\r\n\r\nC) Hypocalcaemia due to magnesium sulfate \u2013 Incorrect. Hypocalcaemia is not a common adverse effect of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma treatment.\r\n\r\nD) Hypercalcaemia due to ipratropium bromide \u2013 Incorrect. Ipratropium is an anticholinergic and does not affect calcium levels.\r\n\r\nE) Hyponatraemia due to salbutamol \u2013 Incorrect.

    "why": "Duloxetine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is licensed for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. It works by increasing the tone of the urethral sphincter muscles during the storage phase of the micturition cycle, helping to reduce urine leakage. Duloxetine is typically recommended for women who have not responded adequately to pelvic floor muscle exercises and lifestyle modifications.\r\n\r\nDuloxetine is an appropriate option for this 40-year-old woman, who has no contraindications or other medical conditions. It should be started at a low dose (e.g., 20 mg twice daily) to minimise potential side effects, such as nausea or fatigue, and then adjusted based on tolerability and response.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\nA: Alprostadil\r\n\r\nAlprostadil is used for erectile dysfunction and is not indicated for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nC: Desmopressin\r\n\r\nDesmopressin reduces urine production and is used for nocturnal enuresis or diabetes insipidus, not for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nD: Mirabegron\r\n\r\nMirabegron is used for overactive bladder syndrome, not for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nE: Oxybutynin\r\n\r\nOxybutynin is an anticholinergic used to manage overactive bladder symptoms but is not indicated for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nF: Sildenafil\r\n\r\nSildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction and has no role in stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nG: Solifenacin\r\n\r\nSolifenacin is an anticholinergic used for overactive bladder syndrome, not for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nH: Tolterodine\r\n\r\nTolterodine is another anticholinergic for overactive bladder syndrome and is not appropriate for stress urinary incontinence.\r\n\r\nStress urinary incontinence (SUI) is characterised by involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercise. According to NICE NG123, first-line management includes pelvic floor muscle training for at least 3 months and lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and fluid management. For women who do not respond to these interventions, duloxetine can be offered as a pharmacological option. Duloxetine works by improving urethral sphincter tone, reducing the risk of leakage. However, women should be counselled on potential side effects, such as nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue, and monitored regularly to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 32-year-old woman comes to your pharmacy on Friday afternoon and requests emergency contraception. She tells you that she had unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI) with her partner on Monday night. She is not using any regular method of contraception. She has a history of migraine with aura, severe uncontrolled asthma and hypertension. She has no allergies.",
    "why": "Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) within 5 days of UPSI\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception (EC), with a failure rate of less than 1%. It works by preventing fertilisation and implantation and can be inserted up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI) or up to 5 days after ovulation, whichever is later. Additionally, it provides long-term contraception if desired.\r\n\r\nGiven the patient\u2019s history of migraine with aura (a contraindication to hormonal contraception like ulipristal acetate or levonorgestrel), and her conditions such as severe asthma and hypertension, the Cu-IUD is the safest and most effective option for her.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Combined oral contraceptive pill for 21 days\r\n\r\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill is not licensed for emergency contraception. Additionally, it is contraindicated in this patient due to her migraine with aura, which increases the risk of stroke when using oestrogen-containing contraceptives.\r\n\r\nC: Desogestrel 75 micrograms daily for 14 days\r\n\r\nDesogestrel is a progestogen-only contraceptive used for regular contraception, not for emergency contraception.\r\n\r\nD: Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg as soon as possible\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel can be used within 72 hours (3 days) of UPSI, but this patient had intercourse 4 days ago, which exceeds the time frame. Levonorgestrel is also less effective than a Cu-IUD when inserted later in the fertility window.\r\n\r\nE: Ulipristal acetate 30 mg as soon as possible\r\n\r\nAlthough ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) is effective for up to 120 hours (5 days) after UPSI, it is not recommended for women with severe uncontrolled asthma because it acts as a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) and can worsen asthma symptoms. Additionally, this patient\u2019s migraine with aura raises concerns about hormonal methods of contraception.\r\n\r\nEmergency contraception (EC) is essential for preventing unintended pregnancies after UPSI. The NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary (CKS) on Emergency Contraception and BNF guidance recommend the Cu-IUD as the first-line method due to its superior efficacy, ability to prevent fertilisation and implantation, and long-term contraceptive benefits. For hormonal methods, ulipristal acetate can be used up to 5 days post-UPSI, while levonorgestrel is licensed for use within 72 hours. However, individual factors such as medical history (e.g., migraines with aura, asthma, hypertension) and the timing of UPSI should guide the choice of EC.\r\n\r\nPatients should also be counselled about follow-up, STI testing (if appropriate), and options for ongoing contraception. Offering informed choices and tailoring recommendations to the patient\u2019s specific circumstances ensures optimal outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nE. The dose of salbutamol is too high\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe symptoms described: tremor, palpitations, and headache, are all recognised dose-related side effects of salbutamol, a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA). \r\nAccording to the BNF and NICE asthma guidance, excessive use of salbutamol increases the risk of these adverse effects, particularly tremor in the hands, which often occurs in the first few days or when the dose is too high or used too frequently.\r\n\r\nThese side effects are not typically caused by faulty devices or incorrect technique but rather due to systemic beta-2 agonist stimulation. It is a signal that the asthma may not be well controlled and that the patient may require a preventer (e.g. inhaled corticosteroid or ICS\u2013formoterol as per updated NICE guidelines).\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Expired inhaler\r\n\r\nUnlikely. An expired inhaler may fail to deliver an effective dose, potentially leading to under-treatment \u2014 but not typically to tremor or palpitations.\r\n\r\nB. Faulty inhaler\r\n\r\nA faulty device may result in poor drug delivery, not excessive side effects. Faulty devices are associated with lack of symptom relief, not toxicity.\r\n\r\nC. Incorrect inhaler technique\r\n\r\nIncorrect technique leads to reduced drug absorption in the lungs \u2014 again causing under-treatment rather than systemic effects like tremor or palpitations.\r\n\r\nD. The dose of salbutamol is too low\r\n\r\nToo low a dose would not cause side effects. In fact, underdosing would more likely result in worsening asthma symptoms, not tremor or tachycardia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- ICS\u2013formoterol is now preferred as a first-line reliever in asthma management for those 12 years and older.\r\n\r\nOver-reliance on SABAs like salbutamol is discouraged, as it is associated with:\r\n\r\n- Poor asthma control\r\n\r\n- Increased risk of hospital admission\r\n\r\n- Increased asthma mortality\r\n\r\n- Frequent SABA use (e.g. >3 inhalers/year) should prompt a review of asthma control and consideration of step-up therapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson (Chapter 3): \r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

They are currently using salbutamol inhaler (100 micrograms per dose) as required and has recently been prescribed clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for a chest infection. \r\n\r\nIn addition, they are also prescribed a regular dose of theophylline (Uniphyllin Continus\u00ae 150 mg twice daily) for the past year and their peak expiratory flow rate is 90% of her personal best, and they take sertraline 100 mg tablets for anxiety.",
    "why": "Correct answer: A) Clarithromycin increases the exposure to theophylline\r\n\r\nRationale:\u2028Clarithromycin is a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, and theophylline is metabolised by this enzyme. When the two drugs are used together, clarithromycin can reduce the metabolism of theophylline, leading to increased plasma levels of theophylline and a higher risk of toxicity. Symptoms of theophylline toxicity include nausea, vomiting, palpitations, tremors, agitation, and in severe cases, seizures or arrhythmias.\r\n\r\nEven though the patient's lung function appears stable (PEFR 90% of personal best), the onset of systemic symptoms in the context of a drug interaction suggests toxicity is likely.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nB) Clarithromycin decreases the exposure to theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. It increases it due to reduced metabolism, not decreases.\r\n\r\nC) Theophylline increases the exposure to sertraline \u2013 Incorrect. No significant pharmacokinetic interaction between theophylline and sertraline.\r\n\r\nD) Theophylline decreases the exposure to sertraline \u2013 Incorrect. There is no evidence of theophylline affecting sertraline levels.\r\n\r\nE) Theophylline increases the risk of bleeding with sertraline \u2013 Incorrect. While sertraline can increase bleeding risk (especially with NSAIDs or anticoagulants), theophylline is not associated with increased bleeding.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\n* Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A4, increasing levels of theophylline.\r\n* Theophylline toxicity presents with GI, neurological, and cardiac symptoms.\r\n* Drug interactions should always be considered when initiating macrolide antibiotics in patients on long-term theophylline.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system): https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He uses a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) as needed, but reports needing it more than four times a week",
    "why": "Correct Answer: A) Add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, for patients with COPD who remain symptomatic or continue to have exacerbations while on LABA/ICS therapy, the next step is to add a LAMA to initiate triple therapy.

Her symptoms \u2014 fever, chills, sore throat, and confirmed low white cell count \u2014 are classic features of a neutropenic infection or febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency in cancer care.

Agents like carboplatin and paclitaxel are known to suppress bone marrow function, leading to reduced white cell production. This places patients at high risk of infection, often without the usual signs of inflammation due to impaired immune response. NICE guidelines stress the importance of recognising febrile neutropenia early \u2014 typically defined as a temperature >38\u00b0C with a neutrophil count <0.5 \u00d7 10\u2079/L \u2014 and initiating empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately. Pharmacists and healthcare professionals must educate patients to report signs such as sore throat, fever, or rigors promptly, as delayed treatment can be fatal.

He has failed to respond to two different phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors.",
    "why": "A. Alprostadil 500 micrograms intraurethrally as required\r\n\r\nAlprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is recommended as the second-line treatment for erectile dysfunction in patients who do not respond to phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. It can be administered intraurethrally, intracavernosally, or as a topical cream. Alprostadil works by relaxing smooth muscle and dilating the penile arteries, increasing blood flow to the penis independent of sexual stimulation.\r\n\r\nThe patient has not responded to two different PDE-5 inhibitors, making him a candidate for second-line treatment. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a specialist at this stage, where second-line therapies like alprostadil may be initiated under supervision. Alprostadil provides a direct pharmacological approach to address erectile dysfunction and can be used in patients with normal vascular function who fail to respond to oral PDE-5 inhibitors.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Avanafil 100 mg orally as required:\r\n\r\nAvanafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor, similar to sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil. Since the patient has already failed to respond to two different PDE-5 inhibitors, further attempts with another PDE-5 inhibitor are unlikely to succeed and would not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nC. Sildenafil 50 mg orally as required:\r\n\r\nSildenafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor and was likely included in the initial treatment regimen. Repeating this therapy in a non-responder is not suitable, as the patient has already failed two PDE-5 inhibitors.\r\n\r\nD. Tadalafil 10 mg orally as required:\r\n\r\nTadalafil is another PDE-5 inhibitor and, while effective for many patients, is not recommended in this case since the patient has already failed to respond to two PDE-5 inhibitors. Switching to another PDE-5 inhibitor would not align with NICE recommendations for non-responders.\r\n\r\nE. Vardenafil 10 mg orally as required:\r\n\r\nLike the other oral options, vardenafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor. Recommending vardenafil after failure with two previous PDE-5 inhibitors would not be appropriate.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend that oral PDE-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, or avanafil, be used as first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction. If patients fail to respond to the maximum tolerated dose of at least two different PDE-5 inhibitors, they should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation. Second-line treatments include intracavernosal, intraurethral, or topical alprostadil. These therapies act directly on penile tissue to induce vasodilation and are effective regardless of the underlying cause of erectile dysfunction. Specialist care is required for these treatments to ensure proper administration and to manage potential adverse effects.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson chapter 7 (Obs, gynae and urinary tract):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Infliximab works by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which plays a key role in inflammation and joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Other Options:\r\n3 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis is more frequent than the recommended maintenance dose for most patients. The SmPC specifies every 8 weeks for maintenance after the initial doses at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The 6-week interval is typically used for more aggressive cases or those with additional comorbidities, which is not indicated in this scenario.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose is typically used for moderately severe to severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis that may require higher doses for optimal effect. However, for patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, the recommended starting and maintenance dose is 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, not 5 mg/kg.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThe maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg every 6 weeks may be used in more severe cases or those not responding to the standard dose of 3 mg/kg. However, for most patients transitioning from methotrexate to infliximab, the 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks regimen is preferred.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks\r\n\r\nThis is less precise than the recommended 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for this scenario. Although 5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks might be appropriate for some cases, 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks is the standard dosing for rheumatoid arthritis patients who fail methotrexate therapy.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 14 weeks\r\n\r\nThis maintenance dose is too infrequent and likely insufficient for controlling active rheumatoid arthritis. The optimal maintenance dose for RA is 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, as specified in the SmPC.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nThe 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks regimen is generally reserved for patients with severe, refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Since this patient has an inadequate response to methotrexate but not explicitly severe disease, 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks is the better choice for maintenance.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nSimilar to the previous option, 10 mg/kg every 6 weeks would be used in severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis. This dosing regimen is not recommended for patients like this one, who have failed methotrexate therapy but do not have the most severe form of the disease.\r\n\r\nEfficacy and Monitoring: Patients on infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis should be monitored for infusion reactions, infections, and other side effects such as liver dysfunction or bone marrow suppression. TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors may increase susceptibility to infections like tuberculosis, so appropriate screening should be done prior to starting therapy.\r\nInitial Dosing: The initial dosing schedule (weeks 0, 2, and 6) is crucial for inducing rapid disease control, followed by a maintenance dose. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor progress and adjust doses if needed.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines also support the use of infliximab at 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks after initial doses for rheumatoid arthritis that is not responding to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal system)",

Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**\u2028\r\nThe SPmC for Infliximab has been provided for you:\u00a0[SmPC for infliximab](\r\nhttps://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3710/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "5 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a patient with ulcerative colitis who has moderate to severe active disease and has not responded to conventional therapy, the SmPC for infliximab recommends the following:\r\n\r\nInitial dose: 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6.\r\nMaintenance dose: 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks.\r\nThis regimen is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with active disease who have failed to respond adequately to conventional treatments such as corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, or immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n3 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose is too low for treating ulcerative colitis. The SmPC does not list this as an appropriate regimen for this condition.\r\n\r\n3 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nSimilar to the above, this dose is subtherapeutic for ulcerative colitis and is not a recognised option in the SmPC for this indication.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nWhile closer to the correct dose, this frequency is unnecessarily frequent for ulcerative colitis maintenance therapy. The standard maintenance interval is 8 weeks, and reducing it to 6 weeks is not supported by the SmPC unless specific individualised adjustments are needed.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 6\u20138 weeks\r\n\r\nThis broader interval could be used for some conditions, but for ulcerative colitis, the specific dosing recommendation is every 8 weeks, making this less precise.\r\n\r\n5 mg/kg every 14 weeks\r\n\r\nExtending the maintenance dose interval to 14 weeks would likely result in inadequate disease control for most patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 8 weeks\r\n\r\nWhile 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks can be used in certain refractory cases of rheumatoid arthritis, it is not the standard recommended dose for ulcerative colitis unless patients fail to respond adequately to 5 mg/kg.\r\n\r\n10 mg/kg every 6 weeks\r\n\r\nThis higher dose and increased frequency are not listed in the SmPC for ulcerative colitis and would likely increase the risk of adverse effects without additional benefit.\r\nMonitoring: Patients on infliximab require regular monitoring for infusion reactions, infections (e.g., tuberculosis), and potential immunosuppression.\r\nAdjustments: The dose or frequency can be adjusted for refractory cases, but initial therapy and standard maintenance regimens should follow SmPC recommendations.\r\nConventional therapy failure: Before starting infliximab, patients should have shown an inadequate response or intolerance to therapies such as mesalazine, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants.\r\n\r\nNICE also recommends infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8 weeks for ulcerative colitis, aligning with the SmPC. It should only be initiated by specialists experienced in managing inflammatory bowel diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 1 (Gastro Intestinal system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "Correct Answer: E) A LABA, a LAMA, and an ICS\u2028\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient falls into Group E according to the GOLD ABCD assessment tool, which is based on both the patient's symptoms and exacerbation risk. The patient's symptoms are moderate (CAT score of 12, mMRC score of 3), and he has a history of frequent exacerbations and hospitalisation. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, his elevated eosinophil count (>300 cells/\u00b5L) is a key indicator for responsiveness to ICS (inhaled corticosteroids). \r\n\r\nTherefore, LABA + LAMA + ICS triple therapy is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) A short-acting bronchodilator as needed \u2013 Incorrect. While a short-acting bronchodilator may be used as needed for symptom relief, this patient's high symptom burden (CAT score of 12) and history of exacerbations warrant more comprehensive treatment, such as dual or triple therapy.\r\n\r\nB) A LAMA and ICS \u2013 Incorrect. The combination of LAMA and ICS is not the first-line choice for this patient, as he would benefit more from LABA + LAMA + ICS triple therapy, especially due to his elevated eosinophil count, which indicates better ICS responsiveness.\r\n\r\nC) A LABA and a LAMA \u2013 Incorrect. While LABA + LAMA dual therapy is commonly used in COPD, this patient has a higher exacerbation risk and eosinophilia, making triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) the more appropriate choice.\r\n\r\nD) A LABA and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. Although LABA + ICS is a common treatment in COPD, LAMA is essential in this case due to its efficacy in improving lung function and reducing exacerbations in patients with higher symptoms and exacerbation risks, like this one.\r\n\r\nF) Azithromycin \u2013 Incorrect. Azithromycin is used for COPD patients with frequent exacerbations and chronic bronchitis, but it is not the first-line choice in this case, where triple therapy (LABA + LAMA + ICS) is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nG) Carbocisteine \u2013 Incorrect. Carbocisteine is a mucolytic and is not the first-line treatment for COPD exacerbation prevention, especially in patients who require more aggressive bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory treatment.\r\n\r\nH) Theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. Theophylline is an older drug with limited efficacy and higher side effects compared to newer inhalers like LABA, LAMA, and ICS. It is not recommended as first-line treatment for COPD.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

A moderate attack would have PEFR 50\u201375%, normal speech, and no distress. This patient is too unwell for this category.\r\n\r\nD) Near-fatal \u2013 Incorrect. This implies raised CO\u2082, the need for ventilation, or respiratory arrest, which are not features in this case.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n* Severe asthma is defined by PEFR 33\u201350%, RR \u226525/min, HR \u2265110 bpm, or speech restriction.\r\n* Prompt assessment and escalation of therapy are vital to prevent progression to life-threatening asthma.\r\n* Always use objective measures like PEFR alongside symptoms to classify severity.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has no other medical conditions or allergies. She attends the pharmacy for her repeat prescription and reports feeling unwell. She says she has been having burning pain in her upper abdomen, especially after meals. She also suffers from nausea and vomiting. You suspects that she may have a peptic ulcer.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nB) Naproxen\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nNaproxen, like other NSAIDs, is a well-established cause of peptic ulcer disease, even when a PPI is co-prescribed. NSAIDs inhibit COX-1, reducing protective prostaglandins that maintain the gastric mucosal barrier. Over time, this increases the risk of mucosal erosion, ulceration, and bleeding.\r\n\r\nWhile PPIs like omeprazole reduce acid secretion and lower this risk, they do not eliminate it \u2014 especially with long-term NSAID use at higher doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Helicobacter pylori infection \r\n\r\nA major cause of peptic ulcers globally, but this patient is on long-term NSAIDs, making naproxen the more likely cause in this context.\r\n\r\nC) Omeprazole \r\n\r\nA proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole protects the stomach and helps treat ulcers, not cause them.\r\n\r\nD) Stress \r\n\r\nWhile stress may worsen symptoms, it is not a primary cause of peptic ulcers.\r\n\r\nE) Spicy foods \r\n\r\nCan irritate symptoms but do not cause ulceration. This is a common myth.\r\n\r\n\r\n- NSAIDs are a common cause of peptic ulcers, especially in older patients or those on long-term therapy.\r\n\r\n- PPIs like omeprazole reduce risk but do not fully prevent ulcers in high-risk patients.\r\n\r\n- Consider testing for H. pylori and review need for ongoing NSAID use in symptomatic patients.",

    "text": "An 18-year-old patient attends his annual asthma review. He is currently prescribed salmeterol, beclomethasone, and ipratropium inhalers. He shares that he often forgets to take his medications and struggles with managing multiple inhalers. He also mentions that his friend with asthma was recently prescribed a single inhaler to use as both a reliever and preventer, which he found much easier to manage.",
    "why": "The most appropriate option is to switch to a MART regimen (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) using a combination inhaler such as Fostair\u00ae, which contains beclomethasone (ICS) and formoterol (a fast-acting LABA). This approach simplifies asthma treatment by allowing the same inhaler to be used for both regular maintenance and symptom relief. It improves adherence, especially in younger patients, and aligns with current NICE asthma guidelines, which recommend MART as a preferred strategy for individuals aged 12 and older with suboptimal control or adherence.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\nA) Increase the dose of beclomethasone \u2013 Incorrect. While increasing the ICS dose may offer better control, it does not address the patient\u2019s difficulty managing multiple inhalers or provide a reliever function.\r\n\r\nB) Increase the dose of salmeterol \u2013 Incorrect. Salmeterol is not suitable as a reliever and increasing the dose without addressing inhaler burden or ICS adherence is inappropriate.\r\n\r\nC) Prescribe a short course of prednisolone \u2013 Incorrect. Prednisolone is used for acute exacerbations, and the patient is currently stable but non-adherent, not acutely unwell.\r\n\r\nD) Stop the ipratropium inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. While ipratropium is not typically part of routine asthma management, discontinuing it without replacing it with a proper reliever/maintenance strategy would be inappropriate.\r\n\r\nE) Switch to budesonide inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. Budesonide alone would not simplify treatment; the patient would still need separate reliever therapy.\r\n\r\nF) Switch to fluticasone inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. Similar to budesonide, fluticasone alone doesn\u2019t solve the issue of poor adherence or lack of a reliever in one device.\r\n\r\nG) Switch to Fostair\u00ae (beclomethasone and formoterol) inhaler \u2013 Correct. This allows for MART use\u2014offering both prevention and relief in one device.\r\n\r\nH) Switch to tiotropium inhaler \u2013 Incorrect. Tiotropium is used as an add-on in severe asthma or COPD and is not appropriate as a primary step in this scenario.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n* MART regimens simplify asthma treatment by combining ICS + fast-acting LABA (e.g. formoterol) in a single inhaler.\r\n* Fostair\u00ae is licensed for MART and improves adherence and symptom control.\r\n* Ipratropium is not standard therapy for long-term asthma management.\r\n* NICE recommends MART for patients 12+ who have trouble managing multiple inhalers or have poor asthma control.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She attends the pharmacy for her prescription and asks the pharmacist if there is any other medicine that can help her.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Misoprostol\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMisoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue used for ulcer prevention, especially with NSAID use. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy due to its uterotonic effects, which can induce uterine contractions, miscarriage, premature labour, or congenital anomalies.\r\n\r\nThe BNF and MHRA both clearly warn against its use in pregnancy unless it is being used for medical termination under clinical supervision.

Used to neutralise stomach acid and relieve dyspepsia. Suitable first-line adjunct for symptomatic relief.\r\n\r\nB) Bismuth subsalicylate\r\n\r\nNot routinely used in pregnancy due to the salicylate content and limited safety data.

    "text": "A 35-year-old female patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer and is about to start chemotherapy. She is concerned about the side effects of the treatment.",
    "why": "Cyclophosphamide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent commonly used in chemotherapy, is metabolised in the liver to form active metabolites, including acrolein, a toxic byproduct. Acrolein accumulates in the bladder and can cause inflammation of the bladder lining, resulting in hemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nTo prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, patients receiving cyclophosphamide are often prescribed mesna (2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium), which binds to and inactivates acrolein, reducing bladder toxicity. Adequate hydration is also recommended to dilute urine and promote frequent bladder emptying.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Cisplatin\r\n\r\nCisplatin is associated with nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) and ototoxicity (hearing loss) but does not cause hemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nC: Doxorubicin\r\n\r\nDoxorubicin is known for its cardiotoxicity, particularly dose-dependent damage to the heart muscle, but it does not cause bladder inflammation.\r\n\r\nD: Methotrexate\r\n\r\nMethotrexate can cause mucositis, bone marrow suppression, and hepatotoxicity, but it is not associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nE: Paclitaxel\r\n\r\nPaclitaxel is associated with peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression, but it does not cause bladder inflammation or hemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nHemorrhagic cystitis is a serious complication of certain chemotherapy drugs, most notably cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, due to the production of acrolein. This toxic metabolite damages the bladder mucosa, causing inflammation and bleeding. Preventative measures include the use of mesna, which neutralises acrolein, and maintaining high fluid intake to reduce bladder irritation. Patients should be counselled on recognising symptoms such as blood in the urine, dysuria, and urinary frequency and instructed to report these immediately. Early detection and intervention can prevent severe complications such as bladder fibrosis or secondary infections.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant Disease and Immunosuppression System)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

This combination is effective in improving symptoms and reducing breathlessness without the need for ICS at this stage.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options:\r\n\r\nA) A short-acting bronchodilator as needed \u2013 Incorrect. Short-acting bronchodilators are primarily used for acute symptom relief, but this patient has high symptoms (CAT score 18 and mMRC score 4), so dual bronchodilation with a LABA and LAMA is more appropriate for better symptom management.\r\n\r\nB) A LAMA and ICS \u2013 Incorrect. While a LAMA and ICS may be considered in some COPD patients, especially those with a higher exacerbation risk or eosinophilia, Group B patients typically benefit from dual bronchodilation (LABA + LAMA) rather than the addition of ICS at this stage.\r\n\r\nD) A LABA and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. ICS is typically added when there are frequent exacerbations or elevated eosinophil counts. For Group B patients, LABA + LAMA dual therapy is preferred for symptom control and to prevent deterioration.\r\n\r\nE) A LABA, a LAMA, and an ICS \u2013 Incorrect. Triple therapy (LABA, LAMA, and ICS) is generally reserved for Group D patients who have high symptoms and exacerbation risk. This patient does not have a history of exacerbations, so dual bronchodilation is preferred.\r\n\r\nF) Azithromycin \u2013 Incorrect. Azithromycin is typically used in patients with frequent exacerbations and chronic bronchitis. It is not first-line therapy for Group B patients.\r\n\r\nG) Carbocisteine \u2013 Incorrect. Mucolytics like carbocisteine are not recommended as first-line treatment for Group B COPD \r\npatients. These drugs are typically used when symptoms like sputum production are prominent.\r\n\r\nH) Theophylline \u2013 Incorrect. Theophylline is an older drug with limited efficacy and more side effects compared to modern inhaled therapies.

    "why": "C) Tamoxifen for 5 years followed by an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIn postmenopausal women (or women aged around 50 likely to transition to menopause), with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer, NICE recommends:\r\n\r\nSequential adjuvant endocrine therapy:\r\n\r\nTamoxifen for 2 to 5 years, followed by an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane), to complete a total of 10 years of endocrine therapy.\r\n\r\nThis approach offers improved disease-free survival and reduced recurrence compared to tamoxifen alone, with better tolerability than extended aromatase inhibitor monotherapy in standard-risk patients.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Aromatase inhibitor for 10 years \r\n\r\nThis may be considered in high-risk postmenopausal women but is not first-line in standard cases.\r\nExtended use increases the risk of osteoporosis and joint symptoms, so NICE recommends sequential use for broader tolerability.\r\n\r\nB) Chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen for 10 years \r\n\r\nChemotherapy is reserved for patients with high-risk features (e.g., node positivity, high grade, large tumour).\r\nThis patient is early-stage with no comorbidities, so chemo is not indicated.\r\n\r\nD) Tamoxifen for 10 years \r\n\r\nA valid option for premenopausal women or those who can\u2019t tolerate aromatase inhibitors.\r\nHowever, aromatase inhibitors are more effective post-menopause, making sequential therapy preferred.\r\n\r\nE) Trastuzumab for 1 year \r\n\r\nTrastuzumab is used only for HER2-positive breast cancer.\r\nThis patient is HER2-negative, so trastuzumab is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nEndocrine Therapy in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer\r\n\r\nTamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks the effects of oestrogen on breast cancer cells. It is the standard endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\r\n\r\nIn postmenopausal women, however, aromatase inhibitors (such as anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) are more effective than tamoxifen in reducing recurrence and improving survival. Aromatase inhibitors work by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens to oestrogens in postmenopausal women.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the current NICE recommendation is to switch from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 to 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, and to continue the aromatase inhibitor to complete 10 years of total endocrine therapy.\r\n\r\nThis sequential approach provides the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability in standard-risk postmenopausal women.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 8 (Malignant Disease and Immunosuppression):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A patient with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is admitted to the emergency department. The patient has a history of asthma and is currently taking salbutamol inhaler as needed. The ECG confirms the diagnosis of PSVT and the patient is haemodynamically stable.\u00a0\u2028\r\nThe SmPC for adenosine has been provided for this question.\u00a0\u2028\r\n[SmPC for adenosine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/11530/smpc.)",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Adenosine is contraindicated in this patient\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for adenosine clearly lists asthma or a history of asthma as a contraindication due to the risk of bronchospasm and respiratory distress, which can be life-threatening.\r\n\r\nAlthough the patient appears to have stable asthma and is only using a salbutamol inhaler PRN, the SmPC does not distinguish between severity levels. Therefore, according to product licensing information, adenosine must not be administered to any patient with current or past asthma.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, an alternative antiarrhythmic, such as verapamil, is preferred if the patient is haemodynamically stable and no other contraindications exist.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) 3 mg as a rapid bolus injection \r\n\r\nThis is not a standard starting dose in adults.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since adenosine is contraindicated in asthma (per SmPC), no dose is appropriate.\r\n\r\nB) 6 mg as a rapid bolus injection \r\n\r\nThis is the standard first-line dose in general clinical practice (e.g. NICE/Resus Council), but not permitted under the SmPC for patients with asthma.\r\n\r\nC) 12 mg as a rapid bolus injection \r\n\r\nThis is used if the initial 6 mg fails in non-asthmatic patients.\r\n\r\nStill contraindicated in asthma per the SmPC.\r\n\r\nD) 18 mg as a rapid bolus injection \r\n\r\nThis exceeds the recommended maximum dose. It would not be appropriate in any adult patient.\r\n\r\nAdenosine Use in PSVT and Asthma (SmPC vs Clinical Practice):\r\n\r\nAdenosine is the first-line pharmacological agent for the acute termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) in haemodynamically stable patients. It works by causing transient AV node block, effectively resetting the rhythm in re-entrant tachycardias like AVNRT.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the SmPC, adenosine is contraindicated in patients with asthma or a history of asthma, as it can provoke severe bronchospasm. This is a legal and safety-based classification in product licensing.\r\nIn such cases, alternative treatments like verapamil or diltiazem are recommended, especially if the patient is stable. These alternatives are calcium channel blockers and do not carry the same bronchospastic risk.\r\n\r\nWhile NICE guidelines allow cautious use of adenosine in mild asthma, if the question explicitly refers to the SmPC, then adenosine is categorically not advised.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 35-year-old man with a history of chronic pain syndrome is prescribed an opioid medication for his condition. After a few days of starting the medication, he presents to the emergency department with decreased respiratory rate, shallow breathing, and altered mental status. His oxygen saturation is also found to be low.",
    "why": "Opioid-induced respiratory depression\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient\u2019s presentation of decreased respiratory rate, shallow breathing, altered mental status, and low oxygen saturation after starting opioid medication strongly suggests opioid-induced respiratory depression. This is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of opioid use, occurring due to opioid-induced suppression of the brainstem respiratory centres.\r\n\r\nOpioids, such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl, activate mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), reducing respiratory drive and leading to hypoventilation and hypoxia. If untreated, this condition can progress to respiratory failure, coma, and death. The first-line treatment is naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, which should be administered immediately in suspected cases.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Asthma exacerbation\r\n\r\nAsthma exacerbations cause wheezing, cough, and breathlessness, but they do not typically present with decreased respiratory rate and altered mental status.\r\n\r\nB: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation\r\n\r\nCOPD exacerbations are characterised by increased sputum production, wheezing, and respiratory distress, but opioid use is more strongly linked to the symptoms in this scenario.\r\n\r\nD: Pneumonia\r\n\r\nPneumonia can cause hypoxia, fever, and productive cough, but it would not typically lead to decreased respiratory rate and altered mental status as early symptoms.\r\n\r\nE: Pulmonary embolism\r\n\r\nPulmonary embolism (PE) presents with sudden onset of dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, and tachypnoea, rather than respiratory depression. Risk factors such as recent surgery, immobilisation, or thrombophilia would also be expected in the history.\r\n\r\nOpioid-induced respiratory depression is a serious adverse effect of opioid analgesics, resulting from suppression of the brainstem respiratory centres. According to BNF Chapter 4: Central Nervous System, patients receiving opioids should be closely monitored, especially if they are opioid-na\u00efve, have renal impairment, or are receiving high doses. If respiratory depression occurs, naloxone should be administered immediately to reverse the opioid effects, followed by supportive measures such as oxygen therapy and ventilation if necessary. NICE guidelines recommend careful opioid dose titration and monitoring, especially in patients with chronic pain, to minimise the risk of respiratory depression while maintaining effective pain relief.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A patient with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is admitted to the emergency department. The patient has no history of asthma and is currently taking dipyridamole 200 mg twice daily for stroke prevention. The ECG confirms the diagnosis of PSVT and two doses have not eliminated the supraventricular tachycardia.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC for adenosine has been provided for this question.\u00a0\u2028\r\n[SmPC for adenosine](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/11530/smpc.)",
    "why": "C. 12 mg as a rapid bolus injection\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe recommended initial dose of adenosine is 6 mg as a rapid intravenous bolus injection, followed by 12 mg if the first dose is ineffective. If the second dose does not terminate the tachycardia, another 12 mg may be administered. For this patient, who has already received two unsuccessful doses, administering 12 mg as the next step is appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhile dipyridamole potentiates the effects of adenosine by inhibiting its uptake, this interaction does not contraindicate its use. Instead, a lower initial dose of adenosine is advised when co-administered with dipyridamole, which may have already been accounted for. Careful monitoring of the patient\u2019s response is necessary to avoid excessive adverse effects.\r\n\r\nExplanation Of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 3 mg as a rapid bolus injection: Incorrect, as this dose is subtherapeutic and not part of standard dosing protocols for PSVT.\r\n\r\nB. 6 mg as a rapid bolus injection: Not suitable, as this dose has already been attempted without success.\r\n\r\nD. 18 mg as a rapid bolus injection: Not recommended in any scenario; this dose exceeds the maximum suggested dosing in clinical guidelines.\r\n\r\nE. Adenosine is contraindicated in this patient: Incorrect. Adenosine is not contraindicated; however, a lower initial dose is recommended in patients taking dipyridamole.\r\n\r\nFor PSVT, adenosine is the first-line treatment due to its rapid onset and efficacy in restoring sinus rhythm. Adjustments in dosing are required in patients taking drugs like dipyridamole, or with other factors influencing its pharmacokinetics. If adenosine fails, alternative treatments such as verapamil or beta-blockers may be considered. Monitoring during administration is essential, particularly in patients with potential interactions.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",
