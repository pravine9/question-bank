    "text": "A 35-year-old patient with psoriasis has been prescribed a topical Vitamin D preparation.",
    "why": "D. 56 days\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines and the BNF, topical Vitamin D preparations should be applied once or twice a day for up to 8 weeks (56 days). This duration allows adequate time for the treatment to show therapeutic effects.\r\n\r\nIf the psoriasis does not improve after 4 weeks of concurrent treatment with a potent corticosteroid and the Vitamin D preparation, the corticosteroid should be stopped. The Vitamin D preparation can then be applied twice daily for the remaining weeks to complete the 8-week treatment course.\r\n\r\nFor patients unable to use topical corticosteroids, the Vitamin D preparation alone is an option. If there is no satisfactory response after 8 weeks, alternative treatments such as coal tar preparations should be considered, or the patient should be referred to a specialist.\r\n\r\nTopical Vitamin D preparations are a cornerstone for mild-to-moderate psoriasis management and must be used within the specified duration to ensure safety and efficacy without unnecessary prolonged exposure.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 13 (Skin):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Hydroxocobalamin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient's blood test results indicate macrocytic anaemia, as seen by the elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 112 fL (reference range: 80\u201399 fL) and low haemoglobin of 110 g/L (reference range: 130\u2013170 g/L).\r\n\r\nThe likely cause is vitamin B12 deficiency, as the patient's B12 level is critically low at 97 ng/L (reference range: 200\u2013800 ng/L). The most appropriate treatment is hydroxocobalamin, the preferred first-line therapy for vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Cyanocobalamin \r\n\r\nWhile cyanocobalamin is an oral form of vitamin B12, it is not recommended for patients with severe deficiency, neurological symptoms, or suspected malabsorption.\r\nNICE recommends hydroxocobalamin as the first-line treatment.\r\n\r\n(B) Epoetin alfa \r\n\r\nEpoetin alfa (erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) is used in anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or chemotherapy-induced anaemia, not in vitamin B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\n(C) Ferrous sulfate \r\n\r\nUsed for iron-deficiency anaemia, but this patient has normal ferritin levels (50 ng/L), ruling out iron deficiency.\r\n\r\n(D) Folic acid \r\n\r\nThe patient has a low folate level (4 ng/L; reference range 3\u201313 ng/L), but the B12 deficiency must be corrected first, as giving folic acid alone can worsen neurological complications in B12 deficiency.\r\nOnce B12 levels are replenished, folic acid supplementation may be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitamin B12 Deficiency \r\n\r\nVitamin B12 deficiency causes macrocytic anaemia and, if untreated, can lead to neurological complications (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord).\r\n\r\nNICE recommends the following treatment:\r\n\r\n- First-line therapy: Hydroxocobalamin IM 1 mg three times weekly for two weeks.\r\n\r\n- Maintenance therapy:\r\n\r\n- For pernicious anaemia: 1 mg IM every three months for life.\r\n\r\n- For dietary B12 deficiency (e.g., vegan diet): Oral cyanocobalamin 50\u2013150 mcg daily can be considered.\r\n\r\n- Folic acid replacement should follow after B12 correction if folate levels are also low.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Nutrition and Blood):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "This is a common side effect of nefopam and is harmless\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nNefopam is a non-opioid analgesic used for moderate to severe pain. A well-documented but harmless side effect of nefopam is urine discolouration, which may appear pink, orange, or red. This occurs due to excretion of drug metabolites in the urine and does not indicate bleeding, kidney dysfunction, or an allergic reaction.\r\n\r\nPatients should be reassured that this is a benign and non-harmful effect and does not require discontinuation of the medication.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Increase fluid intake to clear the discolouration\r\n\r\nWhile staying hydrated is always beneficial, increased fluid intake will not prevent or clear the urine discolouration, as it results from nefopam metabolism, not dehydration.\r\n\r\nB: Stop the medication immediately and seek medical attention\r\n\r\nThis is not necessary, as urine discolouration due to nefopam is harmless and does not indicate a medical emergency.\r\n\r\nD: This is an allergic reaction to the medication\r\n\r\nAllergic reactions to nefopam typically present with rash, swelling, or breathing difficulties, not urine discolouration.\r\n\r\nE: This indicates a serious kidney problem\r\n\r\nKidney disease can cause haematuria (blood in urine), but nefopam-induced urine discolouration is unrelated to kidney damage.\r\n\r\nNefopam is an analgesic that works by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, providing pain relief without opioid-related side effects. According to the NICE guidelines, a harmless but common side effect of nefopam is urine discolouration (pink, red, or orange) due to renal excretion of drug metabolites. This does not require treatment or discontinuation. Patients should be reassured that this is a known and harmless side effect and does not indicate bleeding, infection, or kidney dysfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 35-year-old woman with asthma has been taking ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day for her menstrual cramps. She notices that her asthma symptoms have worsened since she started the ibuprofen, and she needs to use her salbutamol inhaler more frequently. She also complains of mild dyspepsia.",
    "why": "Advise her to stop the ibuprofen and switch to paracetamol 1 g four times a day\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient has asthma exacerbation following the use of ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with asthma who have a history of bronchospasm or worsening asthma symptoms induced by NSAIDs or aspirin.\r\n\r\nNSAID-induced asthma occurs due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), leading to increased production of leukotrienes, which cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory symptoms. Given her increased need for salbutamol, it is safest to stop ibuprofen immediately and switch to paracetamol, which does not affect prostaglandin synthesis and is unlikely to trigger asthma.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB: Advise her to continue the ibuprofen and add a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection\r\n\r\nThis does not address the worsening asthma symptoms. While a PPI may help with dyspepsia, ibuprofen should still be stopped to prevent further respiratory deterioration.\r\n\r\nC: Advise her to reduce the dose of ibuprofen to 200 mg three times a day and monitor her asthma symptoms\r\n\r\nReducing the dose does not eliminate the risk of NSAID-induced bronchospasm. Even low doses can trigger severe reactions in sensitive individuals.\r\n\r\nD: Advise her to stop the ibuprofen and switch to a COX-2 inhibitor such as celecoxib 200 mg once a day\r\n\r\nCOX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) have a lower risk of causing asthma exacerbations compared to non-selective NSAIDs, but they are not completely safe. NICE and BNF do not recommend COX-2 inhibitors as first-line options for NSAID-sensitive asthma patients.\r\n\r\nE: Advise her to stop the ibuprofen and switch to naproxen 500 mg twice a day with a proton pump inhibitor\r\n\r\nNaproxen is also a non-selective NSAID and is just as likely to worsen asthma symptoms as ibuprofen. It should be avoided in NSAID-sensitive asthma.\r\n\r\nNSAID-induced asthma is a well-recognised phenomenon where NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) can trigger bronchospasm in susceptible individuals. According to BNF Chapter 3: Respiratory System, NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with asthma who have a history of NSAID-induced exacerbations. NICE guidelines recommend that paracetamol should be the first-line analgesic for pain management in NSAID-sensitive asthmatics, as it does not affect prostaglandin pathways and does not trigger bronchoconstriction. COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) may be better tolerated but are not routinely recommended unless absolutely necessary. Patients should be monitored for worsening respiratory symptoms when taking any new medication, especially NSAIDs.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The dose equivalence provided states:\r\n\r\n4 drops = 8 mg\r\n\r\n10 mg tablets = 4 drops\r\n\r\nTo calculate the equivalent dose for 40 mg:\r\n\r\n10 mg tablets = 4 drops\r\n40 mg tablets = (40 mg \u00f7 10 mg) \u00d7 4 drops\r\n40 mg tablets = 16 drops\r\nThus, the correct dose of citalopram oral drops is 16 drops once daily, maintaining the therapeutic equivalence of 40 mg tablets.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 8 drops once daily\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to 20 mg tablets (half the required dose), leading to subtherapeutic effects and inadequate treatment of depression.\r\n\r\nB: 12 drops once daily\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to 30 mg tablets, which is still lower than the required 40 mg dose and may lead to ineffective treatment.\r\n\r\nD: 20 drops once daily\r\n\r\nThis equates to 50 mg tablets, exceeding the prescribed dose and increasing the risk of adverse effects such as QT prolongation and hyponatraemia, especially in elderly patients or those with underlying cardiovascular risks.\r\n\r\nE: 24 drops once daily\r\n\r\nThis equates to 60 mg tablets, which exceeds the maximum recommended dose of citalopram, significantly increasing the risk of dose-dependent QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome, and other side effects.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025), citalopram is a commonly used SSRI for post-stroke depression. Patients who have suffered a stroke are at increased risk of developing depression, which can negatively impact recovery and rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nFor patients with swallowing difficulties post-stroke, liquid formulations should be considered, ensuring correct dose equivalence to prevent subtherapeutic dosing or overdosing. Special caution is advised in stroke patients due to the increased risk of hyponatraemia, especially in those with additional risk factors such as older age or concurrent diuretic use. Additionally, citalopram has been associated with QT prolongation, and doses above 40 mg daily should generally be avoided.\r\n\r\nHealthcare professionals should regularly monitor electrolytes (especially sodium) and conduct ECG monitoring in patients at risk of cardiac complications. \r\nNon-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), should also be considered alongside pharmacotherapy for optimal patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 50-year-old male patient has been diagnosed with hypertension. He has been prescribed a thiazide diuretic.",
    "why": "Hypokalemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThiazide diuretics, such as bendroflumethiazide and indapamide, are commonly used to treat hypertension. These medications work by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, leading to increased sodium and water excretion. However, this process also promotes the excretion of potassium, resulting in hypokalemia, a common side effect characterised by low potassium levels in the blood.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of hypokalemia can include muscle weakness, fatigue, palpitations, and, in severe cases, arrhythmias. Patients taking thiazide diuretics should have their serum potassium levels monitored regularly, particularly if they are on medications that may exacerbate hypokalemia (e.g., beta-agonists or corticosteroids).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Hypercalcemia\r\n\r\nThiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion in the urine and may lead to mild hypercalcemia. However, hypercalcemia is less common compared to hypokalemia and is typically seen in predisposed individuals.\r\n\r\nB: Hyperkalemia\r\n\r\nThiazide diuretics promote potassium loss, making hyperkalemia highly unlikely. Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone or amiloride, are associated with hyperkalemia.\r\n\r\nC: Hypermagnesemia\r\n\r\nThiazides increase urinary magnesium excretion, making hypomagnesemia more likely than hypermagnesemia.\r\n\r\nD: Hypocalcemia\r\n\r\nThiazides reduce calcium excretion, which increases serum calcium levels, reducing the risk of hypocalcemia.\r\n\r\nThiazide diuretics are first-line options for managing hypertension in adults over 55 years or in those of Black African or Caribbean descent, as recommended by NICE NG136. These diuretics effectively lower blood pressure by reducing sodium and water retention. However, common side effects include hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia, necessitating periodic electrolyte monitoring. Hypercalcemia may occur due to reduced calcium excretion but is less clinically significant compared to hypokalemia.\r\n\r\nPatients should be advised to recognise symptoms of electrolyte disturbances (e.g., muscle weakness or palpitations) and to maintain a balanced diet rich in potassium-containing foods like bananas and oranges. If hypokalemia becomes severe or symptomatic, potassium supplements or a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretics may be considered.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has tried various topical treatments, such as corticosteroids, analgesics, and antiseptics, but they have not helped much. She has no other medical conditions or allergies. She asks for your advice on whether she should take an oral antibiotic to prevent further outbreaks of ulcers.\r\n\r\nA resource has been provided for this question.\u00a0\r\n[BNF Summary](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summaries/oral-ulceration-and-inflammation/)",
    "why": "Doxycycline\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor recurrent aphthous ulcers, doxycycline can be used as a mouthwash to reduce ulcer severity and frequency. According to the BNF, doxycycline dispersible tablets (100 mg) are recommended for recurrent aphthous ulceration. The dose is 100 mg four times a day for 3 days, to be dissolved in water and used as a mouthwash (not swallowed). This approach helps treat the condition locally while avoiding systemic side effects.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amoxicillin\r\n\r\nAmoxicillin is not indicated for the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers. It is primarily used for bacterial infections, such as respiratory or urinary tract infections, not for managing non-infective conditions like canker sores.\r\n\r\nB. Clarithromycin\r\n\r\nClarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic typically used for bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections or Helicobacter pylori eradication. It is not appropriate for recurrent aphthous ulceration.\r\n\r\nD. Minocycline\r\n\r\nAlthough minocycline is part of the tetracycline group, it is not the first-line option for recurrent aphthous ulcers. Doxycycline is preferred due to its availability as a dispersible formulation for local use.\r\n\r\nE. Tetracycline\r\n\r\nTetracycline is another antibiotic in the same class as doxycycline, but it is not the recommended treatment for aphthous ulcers according to the BNF.\r\n\r\nNon-Antibiotic Options:\r\n\r\nTopical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone pellets or triamcinolone dental paste) are usually first-line treatments.\r\nAntiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine mouthwash) can reduce the risk of secondary infection and provide symptomatic relief.\r\n\r\nAntibiotics in Refractory Cases:\r\n\r\nDoxycycline is used for its anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its antibacterial effects.\r\n\r\nLifestyle and Dietary Advice:\r\n\r\nEncourage stress reduction, avoidance of spicy or acidic foods, and maintenance of good oral hygiene to prevent ulcer recurrence.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 12 ( Ear, Nose, and Oropharynx):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

This regimen provides sufficient stimulation of erythropoiesis to correct anaemia effectively while reducing the risks of overtreatment, such as hypertension or thromboembolism. Regular monitoring of haemoglobin levels is essential to ensure efficacy and safety.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 50 IU/kg twice weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is lower than the recommended frequency for non-dialysis patients during the correction phase and may not adequately address anaemia in this scenario.\r\n\r\nB. 75 IU/kg three times weekly\r\n\r\nWhile this dose may be suitable for some patients, it exceeds the standard starting dose and could increase the risk of adverse effects, such as elevated blood pressure.\r\n\r\nC. 100 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose and frequency are inappropriate for the correction phase, as it does not provide adequate stimulation for anaemia management in patients with a haemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL.\r\n\r\nD. 150 IU/kg once every two weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose and frequency are too infrequent for effective correction-phase treatment, as anaemia requires more consistent management during the initial stages.\r\n\r\nE. 300 IU/kg once every four weeks\r\n\r\nThis schedule is typically used for maintenance therapy or other indications. It is not suitable for the correction phase in non-dialysis patients with chronic renal failure.\r\n\r\nF. 450 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis higher dose exceeds the standard starting dose for correction-phase treatment and may increase the risk of complications, especially in non-dialysis patients.\r\n\r\nG. 600 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is excessive and not recommended as an initial starting dose in the correction phase of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), such as epoetin alpha, for managing anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), including patients not on dialysis. The target haemoglobin level is typically 10\u201312 g/dL, and therapy should be initiated when levels fall significantly below this range, particularly if symptoms of anaemia are present.\r\n\r\nFor the correction phase, more frequent dosing (e.g., three times weekly) is advised to restore haemoglobin levels effectively. NICE emphasises the importance of individualised therapy, regular monitoring of haemoglobin levels, and vigilance to avoid overcorrection, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood and Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "A) Beclometasone nasal spray\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient is taking darunavir, ritonavir, and Truvada\u00ae (emtricitabine/tenofovir) for HIV treatment. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, which can increase the systemic absorption of corticosteroids that undergo significant hepatic metabolism. This can lead to iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression when combined with corticosteroids that have higher systemic bioavailability.\r\n\r\nAmong nasal corticosteroids, beclometasone is the safest option, as it has lower systemic bioavailability and is less affected by CYP3A4 inhibition.\r\n\r\nFluticasone and triamcinolone (Nasacort\u00ae) should be avoided, as they have higher systemic absorption, increasing the risk of serious corticosteroid side effects.\r\n\r\nOtrivine\u00ae (xylometazoline) is a decongestant that does not treat allergic rhinitis long-term and can cause rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa).\r\n\r\nSterimar\u00ae (saline nasal spray) only helps nasal irrigation and does not reduce inflammation, making it less effective for hay fever.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Fluticasone nasal spray\r\n\r\nNot appropriate because it is highly metabolised by CYP3A4, and co-administration with ritonavir has been associated with iatrogenic Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression.\r\nNICE advises avoiding fluticasone in patients taking protease inhibitors (PIs) such as darunavir/ritonavir.\r\n\r\nC) Nasacort\u00ae (Triamcinolone nasal spray)\r\n\r\nNot recommended because it is also metabolised by CYP3A4 and has a higher systemic absorption than beclometasone, increasing the risk of adrenal suppression when taken with ritonavir.\r\n\r\nD) Otrivine\u00ae (Xylometazoline nasal drops)\r\n\r\nNot suitable for allergic rhinitis because it is a nasal decongestant, not a treatment for allergic rhinitis.\r\nProlonged use beyond seven days can lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa).\r\n\r\nE) Sterimar\u00ae (Saline nasal spray)\r\n\r\nNot an effective choice because saline nasal sprays can help clear allergens and mucus but do not reduce inflammation, making them a supportive but insufficient treatment for hay fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorticosteroid Nasal Sprays and CYP3A4 Inhibition:\r\n\r\nCorticosteroid nasal sprays are commonly used for allergic rhinitis. However, CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat) can increase the systemic effects of some corticosteroids, leading to Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression.\r\n\r\nKey considerations when prescribing nasal corticosteroids in patients on CYP3A4 inhibitors include avoiding fluticasone and triamcinolone due to their higher systemic bioavailability and risk of Cushing\u2019s syndrome/adrenal suppression. Beclometasone is preferred due to its lower systemic absorption and minimal interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors.\r\n\r\nPatients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects, such as weight gain, moon face, skin thinning, and fatigue, especially if using corticosteroids long term. If systemic corticosteroid effects occur, the intranasal steroid should be reviewed and switched if needed.\r\n\r\nSince beclometasone has the lowest systemic absorption and minimal risk of interaction with ritonavir, the correct answer is:\r\n\r\nA) Beclometasone nasal spray\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 12 (Ear Nose and Throat):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

They should be given immediately after dispersion as they degrade upon exposure to air, and settling can occur, which may reduce the dose. The dose and frequency may need to be adjusted, as levodopa is mainly absorbed in the jejunum, and its effect can be unpredictable when administered via an NJ tube.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nLevodopa is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, making the NJ tube an appropriate route for its administration. Since co-careldopa (Sinemet) standard release tablets can be dispersed and administered via the tube, this formulation allows the patient to continue their treatment effectively despite their swallowing difficulties. The consultant's preference for levodopa and carbidopa therapy is thus met.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Apomorphine (APO-go) subcutaneous infusion\r\n\r\nApomorphine is not a direct substitute for levodopa and carbidopa. It is typically used as a rescue therapy for patients with severe motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease. It is inappropriate as a first-line alternative in this scenario.\r\n\r\nB. Co-beneldopa (Madopar) capsules\r\n\r\nCapsules cannot be administered via an NJ tube as they must not be crushed. This formulation does not resolve the patient's dysphagia or allow for proper administration.\r\n\r\nC. Co-beneldopa (Madopar) dispersible tablets\r\n\r\nWhile these dispersible tablets are suitable for patients with mild swallowing difficulties, they are not as ideal for NJ tube administration as co-careldopa, which was the patient\u2019s original therapy.\r\n\r\nD. Co-careldopa (Sinemet) controlled release tablets\r\n\r\nControlled release tablets must not be crushed, making them unsuitable for administration via an NJ tube. This formulation also provides slower symptom relief, which may not be ideal for the patient.\r\n\r\nF. Levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (Stalevo) tablets\r\n\r\nStalevo is not suitable for NJ tube administration as the tablets must not be crushed or dispersed. Additionally, entacapone is an adjunctive therapy and not strictly required for all patients.\r\n\r\nG. Ropinirole (Requip) tablets\r\n\r\nRopinirole is a dopamine agonist, not a substitute for levodopa and carbidopa. While it can be used to manage Parkinson\u2019s symptoms, it does not fulfill the consultant's preference for maintaining levodopa therapy.\r\n\r\nH. Rotigotine (Neupro) transdermal patch\r\n\r\nRotigotine is a transdermal dopamine agonist, which bypasses the swallowing process entirely. However, it is not a direct replacement for levodopa and carbidopa therapy.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, Parkinson\u2019s disease management should focus on ensuring continuity of effective treatment despite complications such as swallowing difficulties. Levodopa remains the cornerstone of therapy in moderate to advanced stages of the disease. For patients unable to swallow, alternative routes such as dispersible tablets administered via feeding tubes or non-oral formulations may be used, with careful consideration of bioavailability and administration timing. Adjustments in dose and frequency may be required to maintain symptom control.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson (Chapter 4) Central Nervous System:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A Pharmacist needs to prepare 200ml of a 1% w/v solution of potassium permanganate from a 5% w/v stock solution.",
    "why": "40 ml\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe pharmacist needs to prepare 200 ml of a 1% w/v potassium permanganate solution from a 5% w/v stock solution. This is a dilution calculation where we use the formula:\r\n\r\nC1 \u00d7 V1 = C2 \u00d7 V2\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\nC1 = 5% (stock solution concentration)\r\nV1 = ? (volume of stock solution required)\r\nC2 = 1% (final concentration needed)\r\nV2 = 200 ml (final total volume)\r\n\r\nRearrange the formula to solve for V1:\r\n\r\nV1 = (C2 \u00d7 V2) / C1\r\n\r\nV1 = (1 \u00d7 200) / 5\r\n\r\nV1 = 40 ml\r\n\r\nThus, the \r\npharmacist should take 40 ml of the 5% stock solution and dilute it to a total volume of 200 ml with water.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 10 ml\r\nThis would result in a much lower final concentration (0.25% w/v) instead of the required 1% w/v.\r\n\r\nB: 20 ml\r\nThis would give a final concentration of 0.5% w/v, which is only half of what is needed.\r\n\r\nD: 80 ml\r\nThis would result in a final concentration of 2% w/v, which is twice the required concentration and would lead to an overdose.\r\n\r\nE: 100 ml\r\nThis would give a final concentration of 2.5% w/v, which is much higher than needed and could lead to excessive oxidising effects, increasing the risk of tissue damage.\r\n\r\nPotassium Permanganate Dilution \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025), potassium permanganate is an oxidising agent often used in dermatology for conditions such as wound debridement, infected eczema, and weeping ulcers. It should always be diluted correctly to avoid chemical burns and tissue irritation.\r\n\r\nThe recommended dilution for topical use is typically 0.01%\u20130.1% w/v, requiring further dilution from stock solutions. Miscalculations in dilution can lead to cytotoxic effects, causing tissue necrosis and worsening of the underlying condition. Healthcare professionals must follow the correct dilution guidelines and educate patients on safe use, including avoiding direct skin contact with concentrated solutions.\r\n\r\nFor further details, refer to BNF Lesson 13: Skin (Topical Preparations & Antiseptics) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Influenza vaccine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAsplenic patients (those without a functioning spleen) are at increased risk of infections, particularly from encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.\r\n\r\nAnnual influenza vaccination is recommended for asplenic patients because:\r\n\r\nInfluenza infection can predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections, including pneumococcal and meningococcal infections, which are particularly dangerous in asplenic individuals.\r\n\r\nAnnual administration is necessary as the influenza virus strains change each year.\r\nInfluenza itself can lead to severe complications in immunocompromised patients.\r\nThus, the influenza vaccine should be administered annually to help protect the patient.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: BCG vaccine\r\nThe BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis (TB) but is not specifically recommended for asplenic patients unless they fall into a high-risk category for TB exposure.\r\n\r\nB: Hepatitis B vaccine\r\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for patients at risk of bloodborne virus exposure (e.g., healthcare workers, IV drug users) but is not specifically required for asplenic patients.\r\n\r\nD: Meningococcal B vaccine\r\nAlthough the MenB vaccine is recommended for asplenic patients, it is not an annual vaccine. Instead, it is part of the primary immunisation schedule for these individuals.\r\n\r\nE: Meningococcal quadrivalent ACWY\r\nAsplenic patients should receive MenACWY vaccination; however, it is not an annual requirement but part of routine booster schedules.\r\n\r\nF: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\r\nThis is crucial for asplenic patients, as they are at high risk for pneumococcal infections. However, pneumococcal vaccination is typically given every 5 years, not annually.\r\n\r\nG: Rotavirus vaccine\r\nThe rotavirus vaccine is a live oral vaccine given to infants to prevent severe diarrhoea but is not relevant to this case.\r\n\r\nH: Tetanus immunoglobulin\r\nTetanus immunoglobulin is administered in cases of high-risk wounds in non-immunised individuals and is unrelated to asplenia.\r\n\r\nVaccination Recommendations for Asplenic Patients \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, patients with asplenia or splenic dysfunction should receive the following vaccinations due to their increased risk of severe infections:\r\n\r\n-Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) with Meningococcal C (MenC) \u2013 if not previously received.\r\n-Meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) \u2013 booster doses may be needed.\r\n-Meningococcal B vaccine (MenB) \u2013 part of routine immunisation for asplenic individuals.\r\n-Pneumococcal vaccines (both conjugate and polysaccharide types) \u2013 essential to prevent pneumococcal disease.\r\n-Annual Influenza Vaccine \u2013 required every year to reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infections following flu.\r\n-Additionally, asplenic patients should receive prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., daily penicillin V) for life, particularly in childhood or if they have a history of severe infections.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The doctors order a full blood count which confirms that the patient has anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe results are as follows:\r\n\r\nHeamoglobin: 110g/L (130 \u2013 170g/L)\r\nMCV: 112fL\u00a0 (80-99 fL)\r\nMCH:\u00a0 36 pg (27-32pg)\r\nFerritin: 50ng/L (20-200ng/L)\r\nFolate: 4ng/L (3-13ng/L)\r\nB12: 97ng/L (200-800ng/L)",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Hydroxocobalamin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient presents with macrocytic anaemia, as indicated by a low haemoglobin (110 g/L) and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV = 112 fL, normal range 80\u201399 fL). The most likely cause is vitamin B12 deficiency, confirmed by a low B12 level (97 ng/L, normal range: 200\u2013800 ng/L). Hydroxocobalamin is the first-line treatment for vitamin B12 deficiency in the UK, according to NICE guidelines (2025). It is administered intramuscularly and is preferred over oral cyanocobalamin, particularly in cases of malabsorption, neurological symptoms, or severe deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe patient has a normal ferritin level (50 ng/L, normal range: 20\u2013200 ng/L), indicating that iron deficiency is not the cause of anaemia. Although folate is at the lower end of the normal range, the primary deficiency in this case is vitamin B12. If folic acid were supplemented without correcting B12, it could mask the anaemia while allowing neurological damage to progress.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Epoetin alfa\r\n\r\nEpoetin alfa is an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) used in anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease or chemotherapy. It does not correct B12 deficiency-related macrocytic anaemia, making it inappropriate for this case.\r\n\r\nB) Ferrous sulphate\r\n\r\nFerrous sulphate is used for iron deficiency anaemia. This patient has a normal ferritin level (50 ng/L), indicating that iron deficiency is not the cause of anaemia. Additionally, macrocytosis (high MCV) is not characteristic of iron deficiency, making ferrous sulphate inappropriate.\r\n\r\nC) Filgrastim\r\n\r\nFilgrastim is a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to stimulate white blood cell production in neutropenic patients (e.g., post-chemotherapy or bone marrow disorders). It has no role in treating macrocytic anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\nD) Folic acid\r\n\r\nAlthough the patient's folate level is at the lower end of normal (4 ng/L, normal range: 3\u201313 ng/L), the more clinically significant deficiency is vitamin B12. Treating with folic acid alone could worsen neurological symptoms associated with B12 deficiency, making folic acid inappropriate as a primary treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitamin B12 Deficiency and Macrocytic Anaemia:\r\n\r\nVitamin B12 is essential for red blood cell production and neurological function. Deficiency can result in megaloblastic anaemia, characterised by macrocytosis (high MCV), fatigue, pallor, glossitis, paraesthesia, and in severe cases, neurological complications such as peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include pernicious anaemia, vegan diets, gastrectomy, malabsorption disorders (e.g., Crohn\u2019s disease), and long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or metformin.\r\n\r\nNICE guidelines recommend:\r\n\r\nHydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM three times a week for two weeks, followed by maintenance therapy every 2\u20133 months for life if an ongoing deficiency is present.\r\nFolic acid should not be started without first correcting B12 deficiency, as it may mask anaemia while allowing neurological symptoms to progress.\r\nOral cyanocobalamin may be used only in dietary B12 deficiency but is not suitable for pernicious anaemia or malabsorption cases.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood & Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "3.75 mg/L\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nParacetamol follows first-order elimination kinetics, meaning its plasma concentration reduces by half with each half-life.\r\n\r\nThe half-life of paracetamol is 2 hours\r\nThe initial plasma concentration is 40 mg/L\r\nThe time elapsed is 7 hours\r\n\r\nStep-by-step calculation:\r\n\r\n1.

    "why": "B. Fluorescein sodium\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFluorescein sodium is a yellow-green dye that is commonly used in eye examinations to identify damage to the corneal epithelium. It stains areas of the cornea where the epithelium is damaged, helping to detect corneal ulcers, abrasions, or foreign bodies. The dye can be observed under a cobalt blue light, which enhances its fluorescence, making it easy to visualize areas of injury or foreign material in the eye.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Chloramphenicol\r\n\r\nThis is an antibiotic used for treating eye infections, particularly bacterial conjunctivitis, not for identifying damage or foreign bodies in the eye.\r\n\r\nC. Keterolac\r\n\r\nThis is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for reducing inflammation and pain in eye conditions, such as after cataract surgery. It does not identify foreign bodies or corneal damage.\r\n\r\nD. Lidocaine\r\n\r\nThis is a local anesthetic used for numbing the eye during procedures, but it does not help in identifying damage or foreign bodies in the eye.\r\n\r\nE. Olopatadine\r\n\r\nThis is an antihistamine used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. It does not have a role in identifying corneal damage or foreign bodies.\r\n\r\nFluorescein sodium is a crucial diagnostic tool in ophthalmology for detecting corneal damage, such as ulcers or abrasions, as well as identifying foreign bodies in the eye. \r\nThe dye stains the damaged areas of the cornea, making them visible under a cobalt blue light, allowing clinicians to assess the extent of the damage. It is commonly used in combination with other diagnostic tools and is particularly valuable in the assessment of corneal ulcers, especially in patients with a history of recurrent herpes simplex virus infections.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eyes):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

People with rheumatoid arthritis who take methotrexate and prednisolone are considered to have a severely weakened immune system, so they are eligible for the shingles vaccine from the age of 50\u00b2. There are two types of shingles vaccine given in the UK: Zostavax and Shingrix. Zostavax contains a weakened version of the virus that causes shingles, so it is not suitable for people with a severely weakened immune system. Shingrix is a non-live vaccine that does not contain the virus, so it is suitable for people with a severely weakened immune system\u00b9\u00b2. Therefore, the woman should be given the Shingrix vaccine for free as part of the NHS shingles programme. The pharmacy can provide the service, once signed up and service specifications are met so there is no need to refer her to her GP",

She asks you how to use the spray.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe SmPC of Sativex has been provided for you\r\n\r\n[SmPC for Sativex](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/602/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "A) Start with one spray under the tongue in the evening and increase the dose gradually up to a maximum of 12 sprays per day, until they achieve optimum symptom relief.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSativex is a cannabis-based medicine containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). It is licensed in the UK for the treatment of moderate to severe MS-related spasticity when other treatments have failed or caused intolerable side effects.\r\n\r\nThe starting dose for Sativex is one spray under the tongue or into the cheek in the evening. The dose is then gradually increased, typically by adding one spray per day, to a maximum of 12 sprays per day. The optimal dose varies for each patient and depends on achieving the best balance between symptom relief and tolerability.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Start with two sprays in each cheek twice a day: This would exceed the recommended starting dose of Sativex, increasing the risk of side effects such as dizziness and fatigue.\r\n\r\nC) Start with one spray in each cheek three times a day: Maintaining a constant dose for four weeks without titration is not aligned with the guidance, as doses should be gradually adjusted based on the patient\u2019s response.\r\n\r\nD) Start with two sprays under the tongue once a day: Increasing the dose by two sprays weekly is too slow for achieving effective symptom management within a reasonable timeframe.\r\n\r\nE) Start with one spray under the tongue or in the cheek as needed: Sativex is not intended for \"as needed\" use, as consistent dosing is crucial for controlling MS-related spasticity effectively.\r\n\r\nSativex is a specialised medication approved for MS-related spasticity that has not responded adequately to conventional treatments. NICE guidelines recommend a trial period of Sativex to assess its effectiveness. Treatment should only continue if there is a clinically significant improvement in spasticity-related symptoms, such as reduced stiffness and improved mobility.\r\n\r\nPatients should be monitored closely for adverse effects, which may include dizziness, fatigue, dry mouth, or psychiatric effects (e.g., mood changes).\r\nDose adjustments should be individualised, as response and tolerance can vary significantly between patients.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She says he has had a cold for the last 3 days and she has been giving him xylometazoline nasal drops twice a day, as recommended by her friend. She asks for your advice on whether this is safe and effective for her son.\r\n\r\nA resource has been provided for this question.\u00a0\r\nhttps://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/xylometazoline-hydrochloride/",
    "why": "A) Associated risk with agitated psychosis, ataxia and hallucinations\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nXylometazoline is a sympathomimetic decongestant that can have serious side effects, particularly in children under 6 years of age. The BNF specifically highlights the increased risk of severe adverse effects such as agitated psychosis, ataxia, hallucinations, and even death in young children. This is why its use is contraindicated in children under 6 years. While cardiovascular effects such as hypertension and tachycardia are also possible, the primary concern and the most serious risk associated with its use in this age group are the neuropsychiatric effects mentioned above.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Increased risk of systemic adverse effects such as hypertension and tachycardia\r\n\r\nAlthough xylometazoline can lead to systemic side effects like hypertension and tachycardia, these are more common in older children and adults rather than in children under 6. The more concerning risks in this age group are the neuropsychiatric effects like agitated psychosis.\r\n\r\nC) Increased risk of nasal bleeding and infection\r\n\r\nThis is a potential side effect of prolonged use of nasal decongestants, but it is not the primary concern in children under 6 years. The main risks in this age group are associated with neuropsychiatric and systemic cardiovascular effects.\r\n\r\nD) No significant effect on the nasal symptoms\r\n\r\nXylometazoline is effective in reducing nasal congestion and improving symptoms, but in children under 6, the risks of serious side effects outweigh the benefits, which is why it is contraindicated.\r\n\r\nE) Reduced nasal congestion and improved breathing\r\n\r\nWhile xylometazoline does reduce nasal congestion and improve breathing, the severe side effects in young children, such as agitated psychosis and hallucinations, make it inappropriate for use in this age group.\r\n\r\nXylometazoline, a nasal decongestant, is effective for relieving nasal congestion, but its use in children under 6 years old is contraindicated due to serious risks, including neuropsychiatric effects such as agitated psychosis, ataxia, and hallucinations. The NICE guidelines recommend avoiding decongestants in this age group, as the potential for harm outweighs the benefit of nasal decongestion. Alternative treatments should be considered for young children, and decongestants should only be used under the guidance of healthcare professionals, with careful consideration of the age and potential risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He says he has had a cold for the last 12 days and his symptoms have not improved. He has no fever, allergies, or other medical conditions. He asks for your advice on what he can do to relieve his symptoms.",
    "why": "A) High-dose nasal corticosteroids\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, the most appropriate treatment for acute sinusitis when symptoms persist for 10 days or more without improvement is high-dose nasal corticosteroids. These can help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pain, and pressure. Corticosteroids are typically used for symptom relief, though they are not likely to shorten the duration of the condition.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB) Nasal saline irrigation\r\n\r\nThis option can be useful for symptom relief in acute sinusitis, particularly for clearing nasal passages, but it is generally not the first-line treatment if symptoms persist for more than 10 days.\r\n\r\nC) Oral amoxicillin\r\n\r\nThis is typically reserved for cases where the patient is very unwell or at high risk for complications (e.g., older adults, immunocompromised individuals), or if there is evidence of bacterial infection. Most cases of acute sinusitis are viral, and antibiotics are not necessary unless complications are suspected.\r\n\r\nD) Oral decongestants\r\n\r\nWhile these can provide temporary relief of nasal congestion, they are not recommended for prolonged use due to potential side effects (e.g., increased blood pressure) and are not considered the most appropriate treatment for sinusitis in this case.\r\n\r\nE) Watchful waiting\r\n\r\nThis is an appropriate approach for mild cases, particularly those lasting less than 10 days. However, for persistent symptoms (like in this case), more active treatment is recommended.\r\n\r\nIn line with NICE guidelines, acute sinusitis is commonly caused by viral infections and typically resolves within 7\u201310 days. For cases where symptoms persist longer than 10 days without improvement, nasal corticosteroids are recommended to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Antibiotics are generally not recommended unless the patient presents with severe symptoms, signs of bacterial infection, or other complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the pharmacy with symptoms of sneezing, nasal congestion, and itchy eyes. She says she has been suffering from hay fever for the last few weeks and has tried various over-the-counter antihistamines, but they have not helped much. She asks for your advice on what else she can do to relieve her symptoms.",
    "why": "B) Intranasal corticosteroids\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n\r\nAccording to the BNF, intranasal corticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis. They are effective in reducing inflammation in the nasal passages, thereby alleviating nasal congestion, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Intranasal corticosteroids provide sustained relief and have a good safety profile when used appropriately.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Intranasal antihistamines\r\n\r\nWhile intranasal antihistamines are effective for treating allergic rhinitis, they are generally considered less effective than intranasal corticosteroids for moderate to severe symptoms. They may also cause sedation as a side effect, which can limit their use, especially in people who need to remain alert.\r\n\r\nC) Leukotriene receptor antagonists\r\n\r\nThese are typically used as add-on therapy for conditions like asthma and are less effective in treating allergic rhinitis compared to intranasal corticosteroids. They may be used if other treatments are insufficient, but they are not a first-line option.\r\n\r\nD) Oral corticosteroids\r\n\r\nOral corticosteroids may be used for severe cases of allergic rhinitis, but they are not recommended for long-term use due to their potential systemic adverse effects (e.g., weight gain, increased blood pressure, osteoporosis). They are typically used only for short-term flare-ups or when other treatments have failed.\r\n\r\nE) Oral decongestants\r\n\r\nOral decongestants may provide temporary relief of nasal congestion but should not be used for extended periods due to the risk of rebound congestion, as well as side effects like hypertension and insomnia. They are not suitable as a long-term solution for allergic rhinitis.\r\n\r\nIn line with NICE guidelines, intranasal corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis and are recommended as first-line therapy. These corticosteroids help control the inflammatory response in the nasal passages, offering relief from symptoms such as congestion, sneezing, and itching. For patients who do not respond adequately to intranasal corticosteroids, intranasal antihistamines or leukotriene receptor antagonists may be considered as additional treatments. Oral decongestants and oral corticosteroids should be avoided for long-term use due to their side effects.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson chapter 13 (Skin):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A patient is to be initiated on lithium therapy after several treatment failures with other antipsychotics.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Hyponatraemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nLithium is a narrow therapeutic index drug, and sodium balance plays a crucial role in its excretion. Hyponatraemia increases lithium reabsorption in the kidneys, predisposing the patient to lithium toxicity. Therefore, sodium levels must be corrected before initiation to minimise this risk. NICE guidelines (2025) state that baseline renal function, electrolytes (including sodium), and thyroid function should be checked before starting lithium therapy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Hypercalcaemia \r\n\r\n Lithium use can itself cause hypercalcaemia by affecting parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulation. However, pre-existing hypercalcaemia does not necessarily need correction before initiation. Monitoring is recommended.\r\n\r\nB) Hyperkalaemia \r\n\r\nLithium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, but it does not have a direct impact on potassium regulation in the same way it affects sodium. Although hyperkalaemia requires management, it is not a contraindication to lithium initiation.\r\n\r\nC) Hypermagnesaemia \r\n\r\nMagnesium levels do not significantly impact lithium metabolism or toxicity risk, so it is not a priority for correction before starting lithium.\r\n\r\nE) Hypophosphataemia \r\n\r\nLow phosphate levels do not influence lithium clearance or toxicity, so correction is not required before initiation.\r\n\r\nLithium and Sodium Balance:\r\n\r\n- Lithium competes with sodium for renal excretion. If sodium levels are low (hyponatraemia), lithium is retained, increasing the risk of toxicity.\r\n\r\n- Maintaining stable sodium intake and hydration is essential. Patients should be advised to avoid excessive sodium restriction or dehydration.\r\n\r\n- Routine monitoring of lithium levels, renal function, and electrolytes is essential throughout treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nC) Pamidronate 18 mg, 100 mL diluent volume, 25 mL/hour infusion rate, 10.8 mmol daily calcium dose.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a 6-year-old child weighing 18 kg, the correct standard treatment protocol is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Pamidronate Dose Calculation:\r\n\r\n- Standard dose: 1 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days (as per protocol for children >10 kg).\r\n- Child's weight: 18 kg\r\n- Pamidronate dose = 1 mg/kg \u00d7 18 kg = 18 mg/day\r\n- Correct dose: 18 mg/day for 3 days\r\n\r\n2. Diluent Volume & Infusion Rate:\r\n\r\n    According to the administration table:\r\n\r\n- Dose <20 mg \u2192 Requires 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride.\r\n- Standard infusion duration: 4 hours.\r\n- Infusion rate = 100 mL \u00f7 4 hours = 25 mL/hour.\r\n- Correct diluent volume: 100 mL\r\n- Correct infusion rate: 25 mL/hour\r\n\r\n3. Calcium Supplementation:\r\n\r\n- The protocol requires 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses.\r\n- 50 mg/kg \u00d7 18 kg = 900 mg/day.\r\n- 900 mg calcium is equivalent to approximately 10.8 mmol/day (as 1 mmol calcium \u2248 83.3 mg).\r\n- Correct daily calcium dose: 10.8 mmol/day.\r\n\r\n\r\nPamidronate in the Treatment of Osteogenesis Imperfecta\r\n\r\nPamidronate is a bisphosphonate used to improve bone density and reduce fractures in paediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). It works by inhibiting osteoclast activity, slowing down bone resorption, and increasing bone mineralisation.\r\n\r\nStandard dosing for children >10 kg: 1 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days per cycle, repeated at set intervals (e.g., every 2\u20133 months).\r\nFluid hydration is essential before and after administration to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity.\r\nCalcium supplementation is required to prevent hypocalcaemia, which can occur due to increased bone mineralisation.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You are working as a Pharmacist Manager in your local community pharmacy. You are refreshing your first-aid knowledge",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Putting your finger in to remove it\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a 7-year-old child with airway obstruction, first-aid guidance prioritises effective techniques that encourage spontaneous clearance while minimising further complications. Blind finger sweeps (putting your finger in the mouth to remove an object) are not usually recommended, as they may:\r\n\r\n- Push the object further down the airway, worsening the obstruction.\r\n- Cause soft tissue injury in the mouth or throat.\r\n- Trigger gagging or vomiting, increasing the risk of aspiration.\r\n\r\nInstead, NICE guidelines recommend:\r\n\r\n- Encouraging coughing (if the child is still able to breathe and make noise).\r\n- Performing five sharp back blows if the obstruction does not clear.\r\n- Giving abdominal thrusts if back blows are ineffective.\r\n- Seeking emergency help (999) if the obstruction is not relieved.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Encouraging coughing \r\n\r\nRecommended as the first response in partial airway obstruction. If the child can cough effectively, they should be encouraged to do so to clear the blockage.\r\n\r\n(B) Giving five sharp back blows \r\n\r\nIf coughing is ineffective, NICE guidelines advise delivering up to five back blows between the shoulder blades using the heel of the hand.\r\n\r\n(C) Giving abdominal thrusts \r\n\r\nIf back blows fail, abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre) should be used in children over 1 year of age. The child should be standing or sitting, and the thrust should be applied by placing a fist above the navel and pulling inwards and upwards.\r\n\r\n(E) Getting the child to pick it out themselves \r\n\r\nIf the object is visible and reachable, the child can carefully remove it themselves. However, forced removal is discouraged unless the obstruction is obvious and can be extracted safely.\r\n\r\nAirway Obstruction in Children \r\n\r\nChoking is a medical emergency that requires immediate and appropriate intervention. In children aged over 1 year, the recommended first-aid sequence is:\r\n\r\n1) Encourage coughing if the child is conscious and able to breathe.\r\n\r\n2) If ineffective, give up to five back blows between the shoulder blades.\r\n\r\n3) If the obstruction persists, perform abdominal thrusts (up to five attempts).\r\n\r\n4) If the blockage is not cleared, repeat the cycle of back blows and abdominal thrusts while seeking emergency help (999).\r\n\r\n5) If the child becomes unresponsive, begin CPR (30:2 compression-to-breath ratio) while awaiting medical assistance.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "1.875 mg/L.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWarfarin follows first-order elimination kinetics, meaning its plasma concentration reduces by half with each half-life.\r\n\r\nThe half-life of warfarin is 40 hours\r\nThe initial plasma concentration is 15 mg/L\r\nThe time elapsed is 120 hours\r\nTo determine the concentration after 120 hours, we calculate how many half-lives have passed:\r\n\r\nNumber of half-lives = Total time / Half-life  \r\nNumber of half-lives = 120 hours / 40 hours  \r\nNumber of half-lives = 3\r\n\r\nNow, we halve the concentration for each half-life:\r\n\r\n1st half-life (40 hours):  15 mg/L \u2192 7.5 mg/L  \r\n2nd half-life (80 hours):  7.5 mg/L \u2192 3.75 mg/L  \r\n3rd half-life (120 hours): 3.75 mg/L \u2192 1.875 mg/L\r\n\r\nThus, after 120 hours, the plasma concentration is 1.875 mg/L.\r\n\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 7.5 mg/L\r\nThis would be the plasma concentration after 40 hours, not 120 hours.\r\n\r\nC: 1.875 mg/L\r\nThis would be the plasma concentration after 160 hours, one half-life further than required.\r\n\r\nD: 0.9375 mg/L\r\nThis would be the plasma concentration after 200 hours (5 half-lives), which exceeds the given time frame.\r\n\r\nE: 0.46875 mg/L\r\nThis would be the plasma concentration after 240 hours (6 half-lives), far beyond the required 120 hours.\r\n\r\nWarfarin Monitoring \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025), warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist used for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prosthetic heart valves. Due to its long half-life (~40 hours) and narrow therapeutic index, careful monitoring is essential.\r\n\r\nKey considerations for warfarin therapy:\r\n\r\nInternational Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring is required, typically aiming for an INR 2.0\u20133.0 in AF.\r\nDrug interactions: Warfarin interacts with many medications, including NSAIDs, antibiotics, and amiodarone, requiring dose adjustments.\r\nDietary considerations: Patients should maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K-rich foods to prevent fluctuations in INR.\r\nBridging therapy: In cases of urgent surgery or high thrombotic risk, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be used when warfarin is temporarily stopped.\r\n\r\nFor further details, refer to BNF Lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "title": "A 65-year-old woman with moderate Parkinson's disease has mild dysphagia and difficulty initiating swallowing. She was previously taking co-beneldopa (Madopar) capsules three times a day, but she finds them hard to swallow and sometimes they get stuck in her throat.",
    "text": "**Theme: Management of Parkinson's disease with swallowing difficulties or feeding tubes in situ**\r\n\r\n**For each of the following scenarios, select the best alternative medicine option from the list above. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**",
    "why": "C. Co-beneldopa (Madopar) dispersible tablets\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a patient with Parkinson's disease and mild dysphagia, co-beneldopa dispersible tablets are the most appropriate option. These tablets can be dissolved in water, making them easier to swallow compared to capsules. They also provide a faster onset of action due to improved absorption.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the patient's difficulty initiating swallowing can be alleviated with the dispersible formulation while maintaining effective management of Parkinson's symptoms. Dose adjustments may be required as the dispersible formulation has higher bioavailability than capsules.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Apomorphine (APO-go) subcutaneous infusion\r\n\r\nApomorphine is typically reserved for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease experiencing severe motor fluctuations or when oral treatments fail. It is not indicated for patients with mild dysphagia and moderate Parkinson's disease as seen in this case.\r\n\r\nB. Co-beneldopa (Madopar) capsules\r\n\r\nCapsules are not suitable for patients who have difficulty swallowing, as they can cause discomfort or become lodged in the throat. This formulation does not address the patient's specific swallowing issue.\r\n\r\nD. Co-careldopa (Sinemet) controlled release tablets\r\n\r\nControlled-release tablets are harder to swallow due to their size and composition. They also have a slower onset of action, which may not align with the patient's needs for quicker symptom relief.\r\n\r\nE. Co-careldopa (Sinemet) standard release tablets\r\n\r\nAlthough effective for managing Parkinson's symptoms, standard-release tablets are not specifically designed for patients with swallowing difficulties, making them less practical in this scenario.\r\n\r\nF. Levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (Stalevo) tablets\r\n\r\nStalevo is generally used when patients require additional symptom control beyond standard levodopa therapy. It is not suitable as an alternative to co-beneldopa for a patient with mild dysphagia due to its tablet form and added components.\r\n\r\nG. Ropinirole (Requip) tablets\r\n\r\nRopinirole is a dopamine agonist, typically prescribed in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy. It is not an equivalent alternative to co-beneldopa for managing dysphagia.\r\n\r\nH. Rotigotine (Neupro) transdermal patch\r\n\r\nWhile rotigotine bypasses swallowing difficulties entirely, it is unnecessary in this case since the patient has a milder issue that can be resolved with a dispersible formulation. It is generally used in more severe cases or for those unable to take oral medications.\r\n\r\nPatients with Parkinson's disease and swallowing difficulties should have their medication tailored to their needs.\r\nDispersible formulations or liquid preparations are preferred for managing dysphagia.\r\nTransdermal dopamine agonists (e.g., rotigotine) may be considered for patients with severe swallowing issues or those who cannot tolerate oral medications.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson (Chapter 4) Central Nervous System:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**\u2028\u2028The sPmC for Eprex has been provided for you.\u2028[SmPC for Eprex](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3442/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "600 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the SmPC for Eprex (epoetin alfa), the recommended dose for patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery with mild anaemia (e.g., haemoglobin 10.5 g/dL) is:\r\n\r\n600 IU/kg administered subcutaneously once weekly for three weeks prior to surgery (on days -21, -14, and -7) and on the day of surgery (day 0).\r\nThis regimen is designed to optimise haemoglobin levels, reducing the need for blood transfusions during surgery. It is effective for managing mild preoperative anaemia in patients at risk of significant blood loss.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 50 IU/kg twice weekly\r\n\r\nUsed for anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis. It is not appropriate for pre-surgical optimisation.\r\n\r\nB. 50 IU/kg three times a week\r\n\r\nSuitable for some CKD patients but not indicated for pre-surgical anaemia management.\r\n\r\nC. 75 IU/kg three times weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose may apply in some anaemia scenarios but is not the correct regimen for pre-surgical haemoglobin optimisation.\r\n\r\nD. 100 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nToo low to achieve the necessary haemoglobin optimisation within three weeks before surgery.\r\n\r\nE. 150 IU/kg once every two weeks\r\n\r\nThis dosing interval is too infrequent for surgical preparation.\r\n\r\nF. 300 IU/kg once every four weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose is used in long-term anaemia management but is not suitable for rapid haemoglobin optimisation.\r\n\r\nG. 450 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative regimen that may be used in specific settings, but the SmPC recommends 600 IU/kg weekly for this scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Surgical Use:\r\n\r\nEpoetin alfa is used to optimise haemoglobin levels in patients with mild anaemia, reducing the need for transfusion during surgery.\r\n\r\nSafety Considerations:\r\n\r\nMonitor haemoglobin levels regularly to avoid exceeding 12 g/dL, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events.\r\nAdminister with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or a history of thromboembolism.\r\n\r\nAlternative Regimens:\r\n\r\nFor patients with shorter preparation times before surgery, higher doses such as 300 IU/kg every day for 10 days before surgery may be used.\r\n\r\nAlways consult the SmPC for specific dosing recommendations.\r\nIndividualise treatment based on haemoglobin levels, timing of surgery, and patient-specific risk factors.\r\nMonitor closely to ensure safe and effective haemoglobin optimisation.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson chapter 9 (Blood and Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He tells you he has recently been suffering from a mild tremor in his hands since his asthma exacerbation. He was recently started on ramipril in hospital to help control his blood pressure. His PMR shows he is also on aspirin, salbutamol, simvastatin, and metformin.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Hypokalaemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Mr W is experiencing a mild hand tremor following an asthma exacerbation. This is strongly suggestive of salbutamol-induced hypokalaemia.\r\n\r\n- Salbutamol, a short-acting beta-2 agonist, is known to drive potassium into cells, lowering serum potassium levels. This effect is dose-dependent, and the risk increases when salbutamol is used frequently during exacerbations.\r\n\r\n- Additionally, the presence of tremor is a classic symptom of hypokalaemia, along with muscle cramps and palpitations. This effect is well-recognised and documented in both the BNF and NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS).\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Hypercalcaemia \r\n\r\nWould present with thirst, constipation, and abdominal pain; no link to current meds.\r\n\r\nC) Hypernatraemia \r\n\r\nTypically associated with dehydration or water loss, not relevant here.\r\n\r\nD) Hypocalcaemia \r\n\r\nWould present with muscle spasms or paraesthesia, not tremor from salbutamol.\r\n\r\nE) Hyperkalaemia \r\n\r\nRamipril can cause this, but it\u2019s early in therapy, and tremor isn\u2019t a typical feature.\r\n\r\nF) Hypomagnesaemia \r\n\r\nMay cause neuromuscular symptoms, but less likely with this drug profile.\r\n\r\nG) Hyponatraemia \r\n\r\nCan cause confusion or fatigue; not linked with tremor in this context.\r\n\r\nH) Hypophosphataemia \r\n\r\nUnlikely without malnutrition or alcohol abuse; not related to current medications.\r\n\r\nSalbutamol and Hypokalaemia:\r\n\r\n- Beta-2 agonists such as salbutamol are essential in managing asthma exacerbations, but they are also associated with dose-dependent hypokalaemia, particularly when used in high or repeated doses. \r\n\r\n- According to NICE asthma guidance and BNF cautions, patients using salbutamol excessively during exacerbations may experience lowered serum potassium, which can lead to tremor, palpitations, or even cardiac arrhythmias in severe cases. \r\n\r\n- Monitoring for hypokalaemia is recommended in patients with frequent salbutamol use, and clinical signs such as tremor can provide early warning of electrolyte imbalance. Education around proper inhaler technique and frequency of use is key in preventing this complication.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood & Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

This protects the heart but does not lower potassium levels. Subsequent steps include shifting potassium into cells (e.g. insulin with glucose, beta-agonists), and removal from the body, such as via resins like calcium polystyrene sulphonate or renal replacement therapy in severe or refractory cases. Monitoring ECG changes and repeating blood potassium levels is critical in guiding further treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood & Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2025 guidelines recommend initiating methotrexate at a weekly dose, typically starting at 7.5 mg once weekly, with the possibility of increasing the dose based on patient response and tolerability. \r\nThe dosing schedule is once weekly to balance efficacy and minimise potential adverse effects.\u200b\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) 5 mg once daily\r\n\r\nDaily dosing of methotrexate is contraindicated due to a significantly increased risk of toxicity, including bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity.\u200b\r\n\r\n\r\nC) 7.5 mg on alternate days\r\n\r\nAlternate-day dosing is not recommended and does not align with methotrexate's pharmacokinetics or established treatment protocols.\u200b\r\n\r\nD) 10 mg fortnightly\r\n\r\nDosing every two weeks is inadequate for maintaining therapeutic drug levels and is not supported by clinical guidelines.\u200b\r\n\r\nE) 20 mg once a month\r\n\r\nMonthly dosing is ineffective for RA management and deviates from standard treatment recommendations.\u200b\r\n\r\nMethotrexate Dosing in Rheumatoid Arthritis:\r\n\r\n- Starting Dose: Initiate methotrexate at 7.5 mg once weekly, with the exact dose tailored to the individual patient's needs and tolerability.\u200b\r\n\r\n- Administration: The oral route is commonly used, but subcutaneous administration is an alternative, especially if gastrointestinal side effects occur.\u200b\r\n\r\n- Folic Acid Supplementation: To mitigate side effects, prescribe folic acid 5 mg once weekly, taken on a different day than methotrexate.\u200b\r\n\r\n- Monitoring: Regular monitoring of full blood count (FBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function is essential to detect potential adverse effects.\u200b\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to educate patients on the once-weekly dosing schedule to prevent dosing errors, which can lead to serious toxicity. Clear communication and patient education are vital components of safe and effective methotrexate therapy.\u200b\r\n\r\nFor comprehensive guidance, refer to the NICE guidelines on the management of rheumatoid arthritis.\u200b\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is a cornerstone in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), offering both efficacy in controlling disease activity and a well-established safety profile. Initiating treatment with an appropriate dosing regimen, as outlined by NICE guidelines, is crucial for optimising therapeutic outcomes and minimising potential adverse effects. Regular monitoring and patient education on the importance of adhering to the once-weekly dosing schedule are essential components of effective RA management.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 26-year old woman has been diagnosed with dry eye syndrome and has been prescribed theoloz duo eye drops, one drop in each eye 10 times a day, Ikervis (ciclosporin) one drop in each eye morning and evening and hylonight eye ointment each evening before bed. She asks you whether she can administer thealoz duo and ikervis eye drops at the same time.",
    "why": "She should leave an interval of at least 5 minutes between administering eye drops\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to BNF Chapter 11: Eye, when two different eye drops are prescribed to be used at the same time of day, an interval of at least 5 minutes should be left between administering the drops. This ensures the first eye drop is fully absorbed and not diluted or washed away by the second drop. Additionally, eye ointments should always be applied last, after all eye drops, to avoid interfering with the absorption of the drops.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the patient should administer Thealoz Duo and Ikervis (ciclosporin) at least 5 minutes apart and use Hylonight eye ointment after all the eye drops, just before bedtime.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Ikervis eye drops need to be administered before Thealoz Duo eye drops\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because there is no requirement to prioritise one drop over the other. What matters is leaving an adequate interval of time to ensure proper absorption.\r\n\r\nB: She should leave an interval of at least 2 minutes between administering eye drops\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because 2 minutes is insufficient time to ensure the first drop is absorbed properly, especially with a viscous product like Ikervis.\r\n\r\nC: She should leave an interval of at least 3 minutes between administering eye drops\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect as it falls short of the recommended 5-minute interval, which is advised for all eye drop combinations.\r\n\r\nE: She can administer both eye drops at the same time\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect because administering drops simultaneously can lead to the dilution or washing away of one or both medications, reducing their effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using multiple ophthalmic preparations, it is important to administer them in the correct sequence to optimise their efficacy, patients should:\r\n\r\n- Leave an interval of at least 5 minutes between administering different eye drops to allow the first medication to be absorbed fully.\r\n\r\n- Apply eye ointments last, as their viscous nature can interfere with the absorption of eye drops.\r\n\r\n- Be counselled on proper application techniques to minimise wastage and ensure accurate dosing.\r\n\r\nFor patients with dry eye syndrome, a tailored approach combining lubricants (e.g., Thealoz Duo), anti-inflammatory drops (e.g., Ikervis), and protective ointments (e.g., Hylo-night) is recommended to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.

    "text": "A 40-year-old male patient has been diagnosed with gout. He has been prescribed allopurinol.",
    "why": "Gastrointestinal disturbances\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAllopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is used in the management of gout to lower uric acid levels by inhibiting uric acid production. The most common side effects associated with allopurinol are gastrointestinal disturbances, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. These are generally mild and resolve with continued use or dose adjustment.\r\n\r\nPatients should be counselled on the possibility of these side effects and encouraged to take the medication after meals to reduce gastrointestinal discomfort. Severe side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome) are rare but require immediate medical attention.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Bradycardia\r\n\r\nBradycardia is not commonly associated with allopurinol use. It is more typically linked to medications such as beta-blockers or digoxin.\r\n\r\nC: Hyperkalemia\r\n\r\nHyperkalemia is not a common side effect of allopurinol. It is usually associated with conditions like chronic kidney disease or medications such as ACE inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics.\r\n\r\nD: Hypertension\r\n\r\nHypertension is not commonly caused by allopurinol. If anything, some studies suggest a potential modest benefit of allopurinol in lowering blood pressure in patients with gout.\r\n\r\nE: Hypoglycemia\r\n\r\nHypoglycemia is not a side effect of allopurinol. It is commonly associated with diabetes medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas.\r\n\r\nAllopurinol is a first-line therapy for the long-term management of gout and other hyperuricaemic conditions. According to NICE CKS: Gout and the BNF, common side effects of allopurinol include gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and diarrhoea. Rare but serious adverse effects include allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), which presents with skin rash, fever, and multi-organ involvement. To minimise the risk of hypersensitivity, treatment should begin with a low dose (e.g., 100 mg daily) and be titrated according to serum urate levels and renal function.\r\n\r\nPatients should be counselled to:\r\n\r\nTake allopurinol with food to reduce gastrointestinal upset.\r\nReport any symptoms of rash, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity immediately.\r\nMaintain good hydration to reduce the risk of uric acid kidney stones.\r\nRegular monitoring of renal function and serum urate levels is essential to ensure safe and effective treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watcH BNF lesson Chapter 10 (Muscoloskeletal System)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "**Theme: Most suitable dose of epoetin alpha**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Instruction: For each scenario, select the most suitable dose of epoetin alpha from the list of answer options. Each option may be used once, more than once or not at all.**\u2028\u2028The sPmC for Eprex has been provided for you.\u2028[SmPC for Eprex](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/3442/smpc#gref)",
    "why": "450 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a patient with cancer and chemotherapy-induced anaemia (haemoglobin 9.5 g/dL) who is receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, the SmPC for Eprex recommends the following dose:\r\n\r\nStarting dose: 450 IU/kg once weekly.\r\nIndication: This dosing regimen is aimed at managing anaemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy, with a haemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL.\r\nEpoetin alpha, a recombinant erythropoietin, stimulates red blood cell production in patients with anaemia, particularly in those undergoing chemotherapy. Starting at a dose of 450 IU/kg weekly provides an adequate boost to erythropoiesis without overtly increasing the risk of adverse effects, such as thromboembolism, which is a concern in cancer patients.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n50 IU/kg twice weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is lower than the recommended starting dose for chemotherapy-induced anaemia. While it could still be used in certain patients, 450 IU/kg once weekly is more appropriate for patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy with haemoglobin around 9.5 g/dL.\r\n\r\n50 IU/kg three times a week\r\n\r\nThis dosing is also too low for the initial treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia in this case. The recommended dose for this scenario is 450 IU/kg once weekly, which provides more consistent efficacy in boosting haemoglobin.\r\n\r\n75 IU/kg three times weekly\r\n\r\n75 IU/kg three times weekly could be considered for some patients, but it is still below the recommended starting dose. For platinum-based chemotherapy patients with anaemia, the more suitable dose would be 450 IU/kg once weekly to ensure proper management of anaemia.\r\n\r\n100 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThe dose of 100 IU/kg once weekly is still too low for this patient population. 450 IU/kg once weekly provides a higher initial dose, which is more effective for managing chemotherapy-induced anaemia.\r\n\r\n150 IU/kg once every two weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose is too infrequent for the management of chemotherapy-induced anaemia. Epoetin alpha should be administered at least once a week to maintain effective stimulation of erythropoiesis. The recommended dose of 450 IU/kg once weekly would be more suitable for this patient.\r\n\r\n300 IU/kg once every four weeks\r\n\r\nThis dosing frequency is too spaced out for effective management of chemotherapy-induced anaemia. The starting dose should be administered more frequently, at 450 IU/kg once weekly.\r\n\r\n600 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is higher than the recommended starting dose. While higher doses may be used in some patients with more severe anaemia or insufficient response to standard doses, it is not the preferred starting dose in most cases. 450 IU/kg once weekly is the standard starting dose.\r\n\r\nMonitoring: Patients on epoetin alpha should be monitored for blood pressure, as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) can increase the risk of hypertension. Additionally, haemoglobin levels should be checked regularly to avoid overcorrection, which can lead to complications such as thromboembolic events.\r\n\r\nDuration of Use: Epoetin alpha therapy is usually continued until the patient's haemoglobin reaches a stable level. If there is no improvement after several weeks of therapy, the dose may be adjusted.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends the use of epoetin alpha for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia when haemoglobin levels fall below 10 g/dL, particularly for patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood and Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "why": "Tiaprofenic acid\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTiaprofenic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has been associated with severe cystitis and haematuria (blood in the urine). This reaction is unique to tiaprofenic acid among NSAIDs and has led to specific warnings from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Patients taking tiaprofenic acid should be advised to stop treatment immediately and consult a healthcare professional if they develop urinary symptoms, such as:\r\n\r\nHaematuria (blood in the urine)\r\nDysuria (painful urination)\r\nUrgency and frequency\r\nNocturia (frequent urination at night)\r\nGiven this patient\u2019s recent NSAID use and new-onset haematuria, tiaprofenic acid is the most likely cause, and discontinuation is advised.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Celecoxib\r\n\r\nCelecoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID that has a lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not associated with haemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nB: Diclofenac\r\n\r\nDiclofenac is commonly used for pain and inflammation but does not typically cause urinary tract symptoms or haematuria.\r\n\r\nC: Ibuprofen\r\n\r\nIbuprofen is one of the safest NSAIDs in terms of urinary side effects and does not cause haemorrhagic cystitis.\r\n\r\nD: Naproxen\r\n\r\nNaproxen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not linked to haemorrhagic cystitis or urinary symptoms.\r\n\r\nNSAIDs are widely used for pain management, but BNF and NICE guidelines highlight that tiaprofenic acid is uniquely associated with urinary tract irritation and haemorrhagic cystitis. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has advised that tiaprofenic acid should not be prescribed to patients with urinary tract disorders and should be discontinued immediately if urinary symptoms develop. Patients should be monitored for signs of haematuria, dysuria, or urinary urgency, and alternative pain management options, such as paracetamol or alternative NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen), should be considered.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nC) Recommend holding the tramadol and reviewing the NSAID; add gastro-protection if the NSAID is to continue\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMrs. O, a 65-year-old patient, presents with a recent fall after being started on paracetamol, tramadol, and ibuprofen for pain management. Given her symptoms of \"not feeling herself,\" the most likely culprit is tramadol, which is known to cause dizziness, sedation, and confusion, all of which increase fall risk in older adults.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ibuprofen (NSAID) poses a significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding risk in individuals over 65. If ibuprofen must be continued, gastro-protection with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like omeprazole is recommended to reduce GI complications.\r\n\r\nKey Considerations:\r\n\r\n1. Tramadol:\r\n\r\n- Risk of falls: Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold, causes sedation, and increases fall risk in older adults.\r\n- Action: Hold tramadol and assess if stopping it improves her symptoms.\r\n\r\n2. Ibuprofen (NSAID):\r\n\r\n- High GI risk in elderly patients: NSAIDs increase the risk of gastric ulcers and GI bleeding, especially in patients over 65 years old.\r\n- Action: If NSAIDs must be continued, gastro-protection with a PPI (e.g., omeprazole) should be added.\r\n\r\n3. Paracetamol:\r\n\r\n- Safe and effective for mild to moderate pain.\r\n- Action: Continue paracetamol as it poses minimal risk.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) No intervention required \r\n\r\nThe fall and \"not feeling herself\" could be linked to tramadol's side effects. Leaving the regimen unchanged could result in another fall.\r\n\r\nB) Recommend adding in omeprazole or famotidine \r\n\r\nGastro-protection addresses the NSAID risk, but it does not address the fall risk from tramadol.\r\n\r\nD) Recommend stopping the ibuprofen \r\n\r\nStopping NSAIDs may reduce GI risk, but it does not address tramadol\u2019s CNS effects, which may have contributed to the fall.\r\n\r\nE) Stop all medication \r\n\r\nParacetamol is safe and effective for pain relief, so stopping all medication is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nPain Management in Older Adults:\r\n\r\n- Opioids (e.g., tramadol):\r\n\r\nShould be used with caution in elderly patients due to increased sensitivity to side effects like sedation and dizziness, which increase fall risk.\r\n\r\n- NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen):\r\n\r\nShould only be used when necessary and at the lowest effective dose.\r\nPatients over 65 should be co-prescribed a PPI (e.g., omeprazole) to prevent GI bleeding.\r\n\r\n- Paracetamol:\r\n\r\nFirst-line analgesic for mild to moderate pain due to its favorable safety profile in older adults.\r\n\r\nBy holding tramadol and reviewing NSAID use, we reduce the risk of further falls and prevent GI complications, ensuring safe and effective pain management.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 35-year-old patient has been diagnosed with flexural psoriasis.",
    "why": "D. Topical corticosteroids\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFlexural psoriasis primarily affects areas of thin skin, such as the groin, armpits, and under the breasts. These areas are prone to irritation and sensitivity, making the treatment approach different from that of plaque psoriasis on thicker skin.\r\n\r\nTopical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for flexural psoriasis:\r\n\r\nEfficacy: Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and itching, providing quick relief from symptoms.\r\n\r\nStrength: Only mild to moderate potency corticosteroids (e.g., Eumovate\u00ae cream) are recommended for thin skin to avoid thinning or atrophy.\r\n\r\nDiscontinuation: Treatment should be stopped once symptoms have resolved to minimise the risk of adverse effects.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Phototherapy\r\n\r\nPhototherapy is not typically used as a first-line treatment for flexural psoriasis due to the difficulty of adequately exposing these areas to UV light.\r\n\r\nB. Systemic or biologic therapy\r\n\r\nThese are reserved for severe or refractory psoriasis cases that fail to respond to topical treatments. Flexural psoriasis is usually mild and can be managed with topical therapy alone.\r\n\r\nC. Topical calcineurin inhibitors\r\n\r\nWhile calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus (Protopic\u00ae) or pimecrolimus (Elidel\u00ae) are useful alternatives, they are generally considered off-label for psoriasis and are used only if topical corticosteroids are unsuitable or ineffective.\r\n\r\nE. Vitamin D analogues\r\n\r\nVitamin D analogues such as calcipotriol (Curatoderm\u00ae) are effective in psoriasis but can cause irritation in flexural areas. They may be used as second-line treatment if corticosteroids are unsuitable or overuse is a concern.\r\n\r\nMild Topical Corticosteroids for Flexural Psoriasis:\r\n\r\nThese are the first choice due to their effectiveness and safety profile for thin, sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nDiscontinuation Once Symptoms Resolve:\r\n\r\nProlonged use of corticosteroids on thin skin can lead to atrophy, striae, and other complications.\r\n\r\nSecond-Line Options:\r\n\r\nVitamin D analogues or calcineurin inhibitors can be used if steroids are contraindicated or excessive use is a concern.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures effective symptom relief while minimising potential side effects.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 13 (Skin):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Tetanus immunoglobulin\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nA dog bite poses a risk of tetanus infection due to potential contamination with Clostridium tetani, a spore-forming bacterium that thrives in deep or puncture wounds.\r\n\r\nTetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is recommended if the wound is high-risk and the patient is inadequately vaccinated or if their last tetanus booster was over 10 years ago.\r\nIf the child is not fully vaccinated, a tetanus-containing vaccine (e.g., DTaP, Td/IPV booster) should be given alongside TIG.\r\nThus, tetanus immunoglobulin is the most appropriate intervention following an animal bite.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: BCG vaccine\r\nThe BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis (TB) and is unrelated to dog bites.\r\n\r\nB: Hepatitis B vaccine\r\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is administered to prevent bloodborne transmission (e.g., via needlestick injuries) but is not relevant for dog bites.\r\n\r\nC: Influenza vaccine\r\nThe influenza vaccine is given annually to protect against seasonal flu and has no role in dog bite management.\r\n\r\nD: Meningococcal B vaccine\r\nThe MenB vaccine is given to protect against meningococcal disease and is not indicated for a dog bite.\r\n\r\nE: Meningococcal quadrivalent ACWY\r\nThe MenACWY vaccine is provided for meningitis prevention but is not relevant in this case.\r\n\r\nF: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\r\nThe pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (e.g., pneumonia, meningitis) and is not related to dog bites.\r\n\r\nG: Rotavirus vaccine\r\nThe rotavirus vaccine is given to infants to prevent viral gastroenteritis and is not applicable for this case.\r\n\r\nTetanus Management \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, tetanus-prone wounds include:\r\n\r\n-Animal bites (including dog bites)\r\n-Puncture wounds with soil, faeces, or saliva contamination\r\n-Crush injuries or deep wounds with devitalised tissue\r\n\r\nManagement of dog bites includes:\r\n\r\n1. Wound cleaning: Immediate irrigation with saline to reduce infection risk.\r\n\r\n2. Tetanus prophylaxis:\r\n\r\n-If fully vaccinated (\u22655 doses): No booster needed unless the last dose was over 10 years ago.\r\n\r\n-If uncertain/incompletely vaccinated: Give tetanus booster (Td/IPV) + Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG).\r\n\r\n3. Rabies prophylaxis: Considered if the bite occurred in a rabies-endemic area.\r\n\r\n4.Antibiotic prophylaxis: Co-amoxiclav is the first-line antibiotic for infected or high-risk bites.\r\n\r\nFor more Information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 14 (Vaccine):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She comes to the pharmacy complaining of a dry mouth and a metallic taste in her mouth. She also notices that her teeth and tongue have become brownish in colour. She asks for your advice on how to manage these side effects.",
    "why": "B) Continue using the mouthwash but rinse her mouth with water after each use\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nChlorhexidine mouthwash can cause common side effects such as dry mouth, altered taste, and staining of the teeth, tongue, and dental appliances. The most appropriate advice is to continue using the mouthwash but rinse the mouth with water after each use. This helps to reduce staining and alter taste, and also minimises the risk of dry mouth. This strategy addresses the side effects while ensuring the ongoing effectiveness of the treatment for gingivitis.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Continue using the mouthwash but reduce the frequency to once a day\r\n\r\nReducing the frequency of chlorhexidine mouthwash could reduce its effectiveness in treating gingivitis, which is counterproductive to managing the condition.\r\n\r\nC) Continue using the mouthwash but brush her teeth with a whitening toothpaste\r\n\r\nWhile whitening toothpaste might help reduce the appearance of stains, it is unlikely to address the cause of the staining effectively. Moreover, brushing with whitening toothpaste could cause abrasion, which may worsen the side effects.\r\n\r\nD) Continue using the mouthwash but switch to a different brand\r\n\r\nThe side effects are related to the active ingredient, chlorhexidine, and switching brands may not prevent these issues, as other formulations may also contain this active ingredient.\r\n\r\nE) Stop using the mouthwash immediately and see a dentist\r\n\r\nStopping the mouthwash abruptly may worsen the gingivitis, and seeing a dentist is important if symptoms persist, but it is not the immediate step to manage the side effects of chlorhexidine use.\r\n\r\nChlorhexidine mouthwash is often used for the treatment of gingivitis. However, its use is associated with common side effects, including taste changes, dry mouth, and staining of the teeth and tongue. According to the NICE guidelines and BNF, the side effects of chlorhexidine mouthwash can be mitigated by rinsing the mouth with water after each use to reduce staining and dry mouth. It is important to continue using the mouthwash unless the side effects are unmanageable, in which case an alternative treatment may be considered. The use of mouthwash should be part of a comprehensive oral hygiene regimen, and long-term use should be monitored to avoid potential complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A 45-year-old man has been using fluticasone nasal spray twice daily for the last 6 weeks to treat his allergic rhinitis. He comes to the pharmacy complaining of blurred vision in his right eye. He says he has no history of eye problems or diabetes. He asks for your advice on what he should do.",
    "why": "B. Central serous chorioretinopathy\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFluticasone is a corticosteroid, and one of its rare but serious side effects is central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). This condition involves the accumulation of fluid beneath the retina, which can lead to blurred vision, distorted vision, or reduced central vision. The BNF states that patients presenting with visual disturbances after corticosteroid use should be referred to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Cataract:\r\n\r\nCataracts can develop as a side effect of long-term corticosteroid use. However, the onset of symptoms like blurred vision is typically gradual and occurs after extended use, not within six weeks.\r\n\r\nC. Diabetic retinopathy:\r\n\r\nDiabetic retinopathy is associated with diabetes mellitus. The patient has no history of diabetes, making this an unlikely cause of their symptoms.\r\n\r\nD. Glaucoma:\r\n\r\nGlaucoma is another potential long-term side effect of corticosteroid use, causing increased intraocular pressure. However, acute blurred vision from glaucoma would likely present with additional symptoms, such as eye pain or halos around lights, which are not mentioned here.\r\n\r\nE. Macular degeneration:\r\n\r\nMacular degeneration is an age-related condition that commonly affects those over 50 years old. The patient is only 45, and this condition is unrelated to corticosteroid use.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, corticosteroids should be used with caution, and patients should be informed about the potential for side effects, including visual disturbances. NICE recommends that any patient experiencing blurred vision or other visual changes while on corticosteroids be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist for further investigation and management. CSCR may resolve spontaneously in some cases, but ongoing corticosteroid use should be reviewed and possibly discontinued to prevent further complications.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eyes):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nA. Acne where topical antibiotics have failed\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is reserved for severe cases of acne that have not responded to conventional treatments. NICE guidelines  suggest that isotretinoin should be used for:\r\n\r\n- Severe nodulocystic or conglobate acne\r\n- Acne leading to extensive scarring\r\n- Acne causing significant psychological distress\r\n\r\nIf topical antibiotics have failed, other treatments such as oral antibiotics (e.g., lymecycline, doxycycline) or hormonal therapies should be trialled first. Isotretinoin is not the first-line therapy due to its serious risks, including teratogenicity (birth defects), adverse effects on liver function, and potential mental health issues.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Acne resulting in extensive scarring \u2013 Isotretinoin is appropriate for this condition as it is a severe form of acne that requires aggressive treatment to prevent further scarring.\r\n\r\nC. Acne associated with psychological problems \u2013 This is another indication for isotretinoin, as severe acne can significantly affect the patient's mental health. If topical or oral antibiotics have failed, isotretinoin can be considered for these patients.\r\n\r\nD. Conglobate acne \u2013 Isotretinoin is commonly used for conglobate acne, a severe, cystic form of acne that can lead to scarring.\r\n\r\nE. Severe acne \u2013 Isotretinoin is recommended for severe acne that has not responded to other treatments, such as oral antibiotics or hormonal therapies.\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is a vitamin A derivative used for severe acne, especially when other treatments fail. It works by reducing sebaceous gland size, decreasing sebum production, and preventing the formation of acne lesions.\r\n\r\nKey Considerations:\r\n\r\n- Pregnancy Prevention: It is teratogenic, and strict pregnancy prevention is required during treatment.\r\n\r\n- Monitoring: Regular lipid levels and liver function tests are necessary to monitor for side effects.\r\n\r\n- Psychiatric Monitoring: There is a potential for depression and suicidal thoughts, so monitoring is critical.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 13 (Skin):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\n(A) Action\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe cycle of behavioural change describes the stages a person goes through when modifying a behaviour, such as stopping smoking. According to NICE guidelines, the action stage refers to the phase where the individual has actively made changes to their behaviour and is working towards sustaining them.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the patient has been participating in the smoking cessation scheme for the past month, attending regular face-to-face meetings and receiving ongoing motivation. Since they have already stopped smoking and are actively maintaining this change, they are in the action stage, where they are making efforts to sustain their progress.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(B) Contemplation \r\n\r\nThis stage occurs when a person is considering quitting but has not yet made a firm decision or taken any action. Since the patient has already started the cessation programme, they have moved beyond this stage.\r\n\r\n(C) Maintenance \r\n\r\nMaintenance refers to the long-term commitment to a behavioural change after sustaining it for an extended period (usually six months or more). Since the patient has only been in the programme for a month, they are not yet in the maintenance stage.\r\n\r\n(D) Preparation \r\n\r\nThe preparation stage occurs when the individual has decided to quit and is making plans (e.g., setting a quit date, gathering support, or choosing nicotine replacement therapy). Since the patient has already quit and is receiving ongoing support, they have moved past this stage.\r\n\r\n(E) Relapse \r\n\r\nRelapse occurs when an individual returns to smoking after quitting. There is no indication in the scenario that the patient has relapsed, so this stage is not applicable.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends that healthcare professionals use behavioural support interventions to help patients quit smoking. This includes:\r\n\r\n- Identifying the patient\u2019s stage in the behavioural change cycle to provide targeted interventions.\r\n\r\n- Providing face-to-face counselling to reinforce motivation and relapse prevention strategies.\r\n\r\n- Offering pharmacological support such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, or bupropion if appropriate.\r\n\r\n- Encouraging long-term strategies for maintaining abstinence, such as self-monitoring, stress management, and social support.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous system):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nE) Citalopram\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe symptoms described, nausea, vomiting, agitation, tremor, nystagmus, and sinus tachycardia, are consistent with serotonin toxicity (serotonin syndrome), which is a known risk with SSRI overdose such as citalopram.\r\n\r\nCitalopram in overdose can lead to:\r\n\r\n- CNS excitation: agitation, tremor, anxiety\r\n\r\n- Autonomic instability: tachycardia, sweating, nausea\r\n\r\n- Neuromuscular changes: hypereflexia, tremor, clonus\r\n\r\n- In severe cases: seizures, QT prolongation\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Aspirin\r\nWould present with tinnitus, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis, not tremor or nystagmus.\r\n\r\nB. Amitriptyline\r\nCauses anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, urinary retention, delirium), arrhythmias, seizures, and coma, but not typically tremor or nystagmus.\r\n\r\nC. Amlodipine\r\nCauses hypotension, reflex tachycardia, and flushing, but not tremor, agitation, or CNS toxicity.\r\n\r\nD. Bisoprolol\r\nCan cause bradycardia, hypotension, and fatigue in overdose. It does not match the hyperactive symptoms listed.\r\n\r\nF. Fentanyl\r\nWould cause CNS depression, respiratory depression, and miosis (pinpoint pupils), opposite of the symptoms here.\r\n\r\nG. Naproxen\r\nA non-steroidal anti-inflammatory; overdose typically causes GI upset and, in large doses, renal impairment or CNS depression, not agitation or tremor.\r\n\r\nH. Paracetamol\r\nEarly symptoms include nausea, vomiting, but no CNS excitation. Late toxicity affects the liver, not the CNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant. In overdose, it can cause serotonin syndrome \u2014 a triad of:\r\n\r\n- Cognitive effects (agitation, confusion)\r\n\r\n- Autonomic instability (tachycardia, nausea)\r\n\r\n- Neuromuscular symptoms (tremor, hyperreflexia)\r\n\r\n- This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.

    "text": "A 42-year-old woman with ocular hypertension and mild asthma is prescribed timolol 0.25% eye drops by her ophthalmologist. She has no other medical conditions or allergies. She uses a salbutamol inhaler as needed for asthma symptom relief. After using the eye drops for two weeks, she reports that her breathing has become more difficult and wheezy. She also feels dizzy and tired.",
    "why": "Correct Answer: D) Stop using the eye drops immediately and seek urgent medical attention\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTimolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. It can be systemically absorbed even when administered as eye drops and may cause bronchospasm by blocking beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This poses a significant risk in patients with current or past history of asthma, and the BNF explicitly states that timolol eye drops are contraindicated in asthma.\r\n\r\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms \u2014 worsening breathlessness, wheezing, dizziness, and fatigue \u2014 strongly suggest systemic beta-blocker side effects. The correct and safest course of action is to immediately stop the timolol and seek urgent medical attention to manage her respiratory symptoms and review her treatment for ocular hypertension.\r\n\r\nExplanation of incorrect options: \r\n\r\nA) Add a nasal decongestant spray to relieve her nasal congestion \u2013 Incorrect. There is no mention of nasal congestion, and this would not address the cause of her respiratory symptoms.\r\n\r\nB) Continue using the eye drops as prescribed and use the salbutamol inhaler more frequently \u2013 Incorrect. Increasing salbutamol use would not counteract systemic beta-blockade and could worsen asthma control. This is unsafe.\r\n\r\nC) Reduce the dose of the eye drops to once a day and monitor her symptoms \u2013 Incorrect. Even low doses of timolol can cause bronchospasm in asthma patients. Contraindication remains regardless of dose.\r\n\r\nE) Switch to a different brand of eye drops with a lower concentration of timolol \u2013 Incorrect. The issue is the active ingredient, not the brand or concentration. All timolol-containing eye drops are contraindicated in asthma.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to BNF lessons in Chapter 3 (Respiratory system):\u2028https://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "Mrs F presents to hospital in a confused and lethargic state and biochemical parameters suggest an electrolyte disturbance. As the ward pharmacist, you conduct a drug history. You note she has been on carbamazepine 200mg twice daily for the past year. Upon speaking to her, she tells you it is for her nerve pain and that she also takes co-codamol 30/500mg tablets and gabapentin 300mg capsules.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nG) Hyponatraemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nHyponatraemia (low serum sodium) is a well-recognised adverse effect of carbamazepine, particularly in elderly patients or those taking the drug long-term. It can cause:\r\n\r\n- Confusion\r\n\r\n- Lethargy\r\n\r\n- Headache\r\n\r\nIn severe cases: seizures or coma\r\n\r\nCarbamazepine can lead to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), causing the kidneys to retain free water and dilute sodium levels.\r\n\r\nMrs F\u2019s confusion and lethargy, combined with her long-term use of carbamazepine, strongly suggest drug-induced hyponatraemia.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Hypercalcaemia \r\n\r\nUsually presents with thirst, abdominal pain, and bone pain. No drug link here.\r\n\r\nB) Hyperkalaemia \r\n\r\nWould present with cardiac rhythm changes and muscle weakness. No risk with her current meds.\r\n\r\nC) Hypernatraemia \r\n\r\nPresents with confusion, but caused by dehydration, not SIADH.\r\n\r\nD) Hypocalcaemia \r\n\r\nAssociated with tingling, muscle cramps, not commonly caused by carbamazepine.\r\n\r\nE) Hypokalaemia \r\n\r\nCauses arrhythmias, weakness; not expected with her medicines.\r\n\r\nF) Hypomagnesaemia \r\n\r\nMay cause neuromuscular symptoms but not the most likely here.\r\n\r\nH) Hypophosphataemia \r\n\r\nCauses bone pain, weakness; unrelated to her current medication history.\r\n\r\nDrug-Induced Hyponatraemia and Carbamazepine:\r\n\r\n- Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disturbance in hospitalised patients and is often linked to drugs that stimulate inappropriate ADH secretion, such as carbamazepine. \r\n\r\n- NICE advises clinicians to monitor sodium levels in patients on such medications, especially when symptoms such as confusion, drowsiness, or seizures are present. \r\n\r\n- Carbamazepine induces SIADH, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatraemia, particularly in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities. In such cases, the offending agent should be reviewed, and fluid restriction or sodium correction considered based on severity. Ongoing patient education and routine biochemical monitoring can prevent this complication from becoming life-threatening.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNFChapter 4 (Central Nervous System) :\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You are working as a Pharmacist Manager in your local community pharmacy. You are refreshing your first-aid knowledge",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Rhinorrhoea (Runny Nose)\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nA severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction that requires immediate intervention. NICE defines anaphylaxis by rapid-onset, multi-system involvement, particularly affecting the airway, breathing, and circulation.\r\n\r\nWhile rhinorrhoea (runny nose) is a symptom associated with mild allergic reactions (e.g., hay fever), it is not a classic sign of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. Severe symptoms typically involve respiratory distress, circulatory compromise, and significant swelling.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Blotchy Skin \r\n\r\nUrticaria (hives) and flushing are common dermatological symptoms of an allergic reaction.\r\nSevere cases may present with widespread, blotchy, or rapidly spreading rashes.\r\n\r\n(B) Itchy and Puffy Eyes \r\n\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis, swelling of the eyelids, and generalised facial oedema can occur.\r\nSevere swelling may indicate angioedema, which can progress to airway obstruction.\r\n\r\n(C) Tight Chest \r\n\r\nA tight chest suggests bronchospasm or airway constriction, commonly seen in anaphylaxis or allergic asthma.\r\nThis is a red flag symptom, indicating respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n(E) Swelling of the Face \r\n\r\nFacial swelling can be a warning sign of severe angioedema.\r\nIf the swelling extends to the tongue and throat, it can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction.\r\n\r\nSevere Allergic Reactions\r\n\r\nRecognising Anaphylaxis\r\n\r\nAnaphylaxis is a rapid, systemic allergic reaction affecting the airway (A), breathing (B), and circulation (C). Key symptoms include:\r\n\r\n- Airway symptoms: Swelling of the tongue, throat tightness, difficulty swallowing.\r\n- Breathing symptoms: Shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, stridor.\r\n- Circulatory symptoms: Hypotension, dizziness, collapse, shock.\r\n- Other systemic symptoms: Widespread urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal distress (vomiting, diarrhoea).\r\n\r\nFirst-Aid Management:\r\n\r\n1) Administer Adrenaline (1:1000) IM in the mid-thigh (anterolateral aspect) \u2013 dose: 0.15 mg (for children <6 years), 0.3 mg (for 6\u201312 years), 0.5 mg (for adults and children >12 years).\r\n\r\n2) Call 999 immediately and state \"Anaphylaxis.\"\r\n\r\n3) Lay the patient flat (unless breathing difficulty worsens in this position \u2013 in which case, they should be in a sitting position).\r\n\r\n4)Administer oxygen and IV fluids if trained to do so.\r\n\r\n5)Repeat adrenaline every 5 minutes if there is no improvement.\r\n\r\n6)Give antihistamines and corticosteroids as secondary treatment after stabilisation.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 3 (Respiratory System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "An 8-year-old who has been prescribed hyoscine butyl bromide patches and topiramate tablets. The child has severe cerebral palsy resulting in hyper-salivation and epilepsy. The parent tells you that the hyoscine hydrobromide leaflet does not mention that it may be used for hyper-salivation. The topiramate tablets will be crushed and mixed in with soft food to allow easy administration.",
    "why": "Correct answer:\r\n\r\nA. The medicine is being used \u2018off label\u2019 as it is being used for an alternative indication\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe term \u2018off-label\u2019 use refers to using a medicine outside of its licensed indication, route, dose, or age group, even though the medicine itself is licensed in the UK.\r\n\r\nHyoscine hydrobromide is licensed for motion sickness and as a premedication to reduce secretions before surgery.\r\nHowever, its use for hyper-salivation (sialorrhoea) in cerebral palsy is not explicitly mentioned in the product information leaflet, making this an off-label use.\r\nNICE recommends that off-label medicines can be prescribed in children when there is sufficient evidence to support their safety and efficacy.\r\nThe prescriber should ensure informed consent is obtained from the parent/carer before prescribing an off-label medicine.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. The medicine is \u2018unlicensed\u2019 because it is being used for a paediatric patient\r\n\r\nA medicine is not considered \u2018unlicensed\u2019 just because it is used in children. If the product is licensed but used outside the terms of its marketing authorisation, it is off-label, not unlicensed.\r\n\r\nC. The medicine is \u2018unlicensed\u2019 as it is not an authorised medicinal product in the UK\r\n\r\nHyoscine hydrobromide is a licensed medicinal product in the UK. \u2018Unlicensed\u2019 applies to medicines that have no UK marketing authorisation (e.g., imported medicines).\r\n\r\nD. The medicine is \u2018off label\u2019 because it is being used in a paediatric patient\r\n\r\nOff-label use occurs when a medicine is used outside its licence for any reason, not solely because it is prescribed to a child. The defining factor in this case is that it is being used for an unapproved indication (hyper-salivation).\r\n\r\nE. The medicine is \u2018unlicensed\u2019 because the formulation is classed as a \u2018special\u2019 item\r\n\r\n\u2018Specials\u2019 refer to medicines prepared specifically to meet an individual patient\u2019s needs when a licensed alternative is unavailable. Hyoscine hydrobromide does not fall under this category.\r\n\r\nOff-Label and Unlicensed Medicine Use in Paediatrics\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE Guidelines (2025) and the BNF for Children, off-label prescribing is common in paediatrics due to the lack of clinical trials in younger populations. Prescribers must:\r\n\r\n Assess the risk-benefit ratio before prescribing off-label medicines.\r\n Discuss off-label use with the child\u2019s parent/carer and obtain informed consent.\r\n Document the rationale for prescribing off-label medications.\r\n Follow guidelines from recognised bodies (e.g., NICE, MHRA, BNFC) when prescribing off-label medicines.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "C. 3.5 mL\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTo calculate the volume of the injection, we can use the formula:\r\n\r\nvolume = (dose in mg) / (concentration in mg/mL)\r\n\r\nThe dose in mg is the product of the dose per kg and the patient's weight, which is:\r\n\r\ndose in mg = (0.5 mg/kg) x (70 kg)\r\ndose in mg = 35 mg\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values, we get:\r\n\r\nvolume = (35 mg) / (10 mg/mL)\r\nvolume = 3.5 mL\r\n\r\nTherefore, the patient should receive 3.5 mL of the injection.\r\n\r\nMorphine sulphate is an opioid analgesic used for managing moderate to severe pain. The dose is often calculated based on the patient\u2019s weight. Careful attention is required to avoid errors in dosing and preparation.

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nC) Lifestyle modifications\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- This patient has severe renal impairment (eGFR <15) and a blood disorder, which limits safe pharmacological options for treating an acute gout flare.\r\n\r\n- NSAIDs like ibuprofen are contraindicated due to the risk of further nephrotoxicity.\r\n\r\n- Colchicine is not recommended in severe renal impairment and poses risk of bone marrow suppression, especially in blood disorders.\r\n\r\n- Allopurinol and febuxostat are used for urate-lowering, not for acute flare relief.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the safest and most appropriate option is lifestyle modifications, including:\r\n\r\n- Rest and elevation\r\n\r\n- Cold compress\r\n\r\n- Hydration\r\n\r\n- Avoiding alcohol and purine-rich foods\r\n\r\n- Urgent referral to a renal or rheumatology team is recommended for longer-term planning.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Allopurinol \u2013 Incorrect\r\n\r\nUsed for long-term urate control, not suitable for acute flares. Should not be initiated or adjusted during a flare, especially without renal dose adjustment.\r\n\r\nB) Ibuprofen \u2013 Incorrect\r\n\r\nNSAIDs are first-line for gout flares in general, but contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR <15) due to the risk of acute kidney injury.\r\n\r\nD) Febuxostat \u2013 Incorrect\r\n\r\nAlso used for chronic urate control, not for acute flares. Additionally, it's not recommended in patients with significant cardiovascular or haematological disorders.\r\n\r\nE) Colchicine \u2013 Incorrect\r\n\r\nColchicine is usually used for acute gout, but in severe renal impairment, the risk of toxicity is high. It should be avoided or used only with extreme caution under specialist advice.\r\n\r\nKey Point Summary:\r\n\r\nIn patients with severe renal impairment, both NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated for acute gout flare treatment.\r\nLifestyle measures are the safest approach until the patient can be assessed by a specialist.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You are teaching your Trainee Pharmacist regarding gastrointestinal risks associated with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)",
    "why": "Ibuprofen 1200 mg daily\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAll non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) carry a risk of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, and GI bleeding. However, the level of risk varies among different NSAIDs.\r\n\r\nAccording to BNF and NICE guidelines, ibuprofen (\u22641200 mg daily) has the lowest GI risk among the non-selective NSAIDs. At higher doses (\u22652400 mg daily), ibuprofen\u2019s GI risk increases to an intermediate level.\r\n\r\nThe relative GI risk ranking of NSAIDs is:\r\n\r\nHigh risk: Piroxicam, ketoprofen, ketorolac\r\nIntermediate risk: Indometacin, diclofenac, naproxen\r\nLowest risk: Ibuprofen (\u22641200 mg daily)\r\nThus, ibuprofen at a dose of 1200 mg daily remains the safest NSAID option regarding GI toxicity.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Diclofenac 150 mg daily\r\n\r\nDiclofenac has an intermediate GI risk and is also associated with cardiovascular risks, particularly at high doses.\r\n\r\nC: Indomethacin 200 mg daily\r\n\r\nIndomethacin is associated with a higher risk of GI toxicity compared to ibuprofen and should be used with caution, especially in elderly patients.\r\n\r\nD: Naproxen 1000 mg daily\r\n\r\nNaproxen has an intermediate GI risk but is preferred over diclofenac for patients with cardiovascular risks. However, it still poses a higher GI risk than ibuprofen.\r\n\r\nE: Piroxicam 20 mg daily\r\n\r\nPiroxicam has one of the highest risks for GI toxicity and should be avoided in patients at risk of peptic ulcers or GI bleeding unless no alternatives are suitable.\r\nParagraph on NSAID-Related Gastrointestinal Risks (Aligned with NICE and BNF Guidance):\r\nNSAIDs increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal complications, such as peptic ulceration, GI bleeding, and perforation, especially in elderly patients or those with a history of ulcers. According to BNF Chapter 10: Musculoskeletal System and NICE guidelines, ibuprofen (\u22641200 mg daily) is the least likely to cause serious GI side effects. Piroxicam, ketoprofen, and ketorolac have the highest risk and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Patients requiring long-term NSAID therapy should receive gastroprotection with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole or lansoprazole. COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) may also be considered for high GI risk patients, but their cardiovascular risks should be assessed before prescribing.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Refer the lady urgently to hospital\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient has multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT):\r\n\r\n- Calf pain and tenderness \u2013 Common symptoms of DVT.\r\n\r\n- Recent prolonged immobility (bedbound due to severe flu) \u2013 One of the strongest risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).\r\n\r\n- Tamoxifen use \u2013 Tamoxifen is known to increase the risk of blood clots.\r\n\r\n- No signs of trauma or injury to the leg \u2013 Making DVT more likely than a musculoskeletal cause.\r\n\r\n- Since DVT is a medical emergency, urgent referral to the hospital is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and start anticoagulation treatment if needed.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Advise simple analgesia with paracetamol plus ibuprofen and to rest the leg \r\n\r\nTreating the pain without addressing the underlying cause (DVT) could delay diagnosis and increase the risk of a pulmonary embolism (PE).\r\n\r\nB) Call an ambulance \r\n\r\nNot immediately necessary unless there are signs of pulmonary embolism (e.g., sudden breathlessness, chest pain, haemoptysis).\r\nUrgent hospital referral is the correct action, but an ambulance is not required unless PE is suspected.\r\n\r\nC) Refer the lady to her GP if symptoms worsen but to use rest, ice, compression & elevation (RICE) in the meantime \r\n\r\nRICE is used for musculoskeletal injuries, not suspected DVT.\r\nDVT requires urgent hospital referral for assessment (D-dimer, ultrasound, and possible anticoagulation).\r\n\r\nD) Refer the lady to book to see her GP and do not offer OTC medication \r\n\r\nA routine GP appointment is not appropriate as DVT is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires urgent assessment in the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) \r\n\r\nDVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. It can become life-threatening if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).\r\n\r\nCommon Risk Factors for DVT:\r\n\r\n- Recent immobility (e.g., prolonged bed rest, long-haul travel)\r\n- Use of hormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen, HRT, oral contraceptive pills)\r\n- History of cancer, smoking, or thrombophilia\r\n- Recent surgery or trauma\r\n\r\nSymptoms of DVT:\r\n\r\n- Unilateral leg pain and swelling\r\n- Tenderness along the deep veins\r\n- Skin warmth and redness over the affected area\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\n\r\n- Urgent hospital referral for assessment (D-dimer test, leg ultrasound).\r\n\r\n- Anticoagulation therapy (e.g., DOACs like apixaban or rivaroxaban) is the standard treatment if DVT is confirmed.\r\n\r\n- Patients should be educated on symptoms of pulmonary embolism (sudden breathlessness, chest pain, coughing blood) and instructed to seek emergency care if these occur.\r\n\r\nEarly recognition and hospital referral prevent complications and reduce mortality. This is why immediate action is required in this case.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Chloramphenicol\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nChloramphenicol is an antibiotic used for bacterial eye infections, such as bacterial conjunctivitis, and is not indicated for allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis requires treatment with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, or combination preparations designed to reduce inflammation and itching caused by allergens.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Antazoline with xylometazoline\r\n\r\nThis combination contains an antihistamine (antazoline) and a decongestant (xylometazoline) and is used to relieve redness and itching caused by allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nC. Ketotifen\r\n\r\nAn antihistamine with mast cell stabilising properties, ketotifen is highly effective in managing allergic conjunctivitis by preventing the release of inflammatory mediators.\r\n\r\nD. Olopatadine\r\n\r\nA dual-action agent that works as an antihistamine and mast cell stabiliser, olopatadine effectively reduces itching, redness, and swelling in allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nE. Sodium cromoglicate\r\n\r\nA mast cell stabiliser, sodium cromoglicate prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, making it a common choice for allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by allergens such as pollen, dust, or animal dander. It is characterised by symptoms such as redness, itching, and watery eyes. The primary treatment involves antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, or combination products that alleviate the allergic response. Antibiotics like chloramphenicol are inappropriate for this condition as they target bacterial infections and provide no relief for allergic symptoms. Proper identification of the underlying cause is essential to guide treatment effectively.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eyes):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

He says he has not changed his diet or oral hygiene habits recently. He asks for your advice on what he can use to treat his infection.",
    "why": "E. Nystatin oral suspension\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nNystatin oral suspension is an effective and safe treatment for oral thrush. It is a topical antifungal that works locally without significant systemic absorption. This makes it ideal for patients taking warfarin, as it does not interfere with the metabolism of warfarin or increase the INR, thereby avoiding the risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Chlorhexidine mouthwash\r\n\r\nAlthough chlorhexidine can reduce bacterial load in the oral cavity, it has no antifungal activity and is therefore ineffective for treating oral thrush.\r\n\r\nB. Fluconazole oral capsules\r\n\r\nFluconazole is a systemic antifungal effective against oral thrush. However, it has a major interaction with warfarin, as it inhibits CYP450 enzymes, increasing warfarin levels and raising the INR, which significantly heightens the risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nC. Hydrogen peroxide gargle\r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide is a mild antiseptic but has no antifungal properties. It is not suitable for the treatment of oral thrush.\r\n\r\nD. Miconazole oral gel\r\n\r\nMiconazole is a topical antifungal effective for oral thrush. However, it strongly interacts with warfarin by inhibiting CYP450 enzymes, leading to elevated warfarin levels and an increased risk of bleeding.\r\n\r\nOral thrush (oral candidiasis) is a common condition caused by Candida species. It often presents as white patches on the tongue and inside the cheeks, which may be sore or bleed when scraped. NICE guidelines recommend topical antifungal treatments like Nystatin or Miconazole as first-line therapy. However, in patients on warfarin, Nystatin is preferred due to its lack of systemic absorption and absence of interactions with warfarin. It is important to counsel patients on proper oral hygiene and to complete the course of antifungal treatment to prevent recurrence.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Sun protection should be worn only on limbs\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis statement is incorrect because sun protection should be applied to all exposed skin, not just the limbs. Isotretinoin significantly increases photosensitivity, leading to a higher risk of sunburn, hyperpigmentation, and long-term skin damage. Patients should be advised to:\r\n\r\nUse a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher).\r\nWear protective clothing and avoid excessive sun exposure.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Dry eyes may interfere with contact lenses \u2013 Correct but not inappropriate. Isotretinoin reduces tear production, leading to dry eyes, which can make wearing contact lenses uncomfortable. Patients may need lubricating eye drops.\r\n\r\nB) It may cause increased photosensitivity \u2013 Correct but not inappropriate. Photosensitivity is a well-known side effect, and patients should be warned to avoid excessive sun exposure.\r\n\r\nC) It may cause skin dryness and cracking \u2013 Correct but not inappropriate. Mucocutaneous dryness is a common adverse effect. Patients should moisturise regularly to prevent skin damage.\r\n\r\nE) You will need to avoid the use of sunbeds \u2013 Correct but not inappropriate. Sunbeds should be completely avoided due to the high risk of severe burns and long-term skin damage while on isotretinoin.\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is an oral retinoid used for severe nodulocystic acne that is unresponsive to conventional therapy. It is highly teratogenic, meaning it can cause severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Therefore, it is only prescribed under the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) for females of childbearing potential. This programme requires:\r\n\r\n- A negative pregnancy test before starting treatment.\r\n- Monthly pregnancy tests during treatment.\r\n- Two forms of contraception (e.g., oral contraceptive + barrier method) to be used one month before, during, and one month after stopping isotretinoin.\r\n\r\nPrescription Validity & Dispensing Rules:\r\n\r\n- Prescriptions for isotretinoin are only valid for 7 days for females under the PPP.\r\n- A maximum of 30 days\u2019 supply can be issued at a time.\r\n- Only prescribers registered in the PPP can issue isotretinoin prescriptions for women of childbearing age.\r\n\r\nFor more Information, please watch BNF lesson chapter 13 (Skin):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nF. Vitamin B12\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPernicious anaemia is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor, a protein needed for B12 absorption in the gut. This leads to impaired red blood cell production and neurological symptoms if untreated. In pernicious anaemia, oral B12 supplementation is ineffective because absorption is impaired. The treatment of choice is intramuscular hydroxocobalamin, typically given every 2\u20133 months for maintenance. Vegans are also at higher risk of B12 deficiency due to the absence of animal products in the diet.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Calcium\r\n\r\nUsed for bone health, not related to anaemia or B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\nB. Iron\r\n\r\nIron-deficiency anaemia is different from pernicious anaemia. Iron would not correct the underlying B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\nC. Folic acid\r\n\r\nCan also cause macrocytic anaemia, but this patient has pernicious anaemia, which is specifically due to vitamin B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\nD. Magnesium\r\n\r\nUsed for muscle cramps and certain electrolyte imbalances, but not indicated in B12 deficiency.\r\n\r\nE. Vitamin B1\r\n\r\nUsed in Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy and alcohol-related deficiencies. Not relevant here.\r\n\r\nG. Vitamin D\r\n\r\nImportant in bone and immune health, but not related to pernicious anaemia.\r\n\r\nH. Zinc\r\n\r\nPlays a role in immunity and wound healing, but not in red cell production or B12 absorption.\r\n\r\nPernicious anaemia results from vitamin B12 deficiency due to lack of intrinsic factor, leading to poor absorption from the gut. The treatment is intramuscular hydroxocobalamin. Vegans are already at risk of B12 deficiency from dietary restriction, and the presence of intrinsic factor deficiency confirms the need for parenteral treatment. \r\nEarly recognition and lifelong maintenance therapy are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage.",

    "text": "A 45-year old female who has hepatic necrosis, which may lead to liver failure, encephalopathy, coma, and death.",
    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nH) Paracetamol\r\n\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Paracetamol overdose is one of the most common causes of acute liver failure in the UK. It leads to:\r\n\r\n- Hepatic necrosis due to accumulation of the toxic metabolite NAPQI when glutathione stores are depleted\r\n\r\n- Clinical progression can include liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, coma, and death if untreated\r\n\r\n- Early administration of acetylcysteine (NAC) is crucial to prevent liver damage and improve survival\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Aspirin \u2013 May cause salicylate toxicity, metabolic acidosis, tinnitus, but not hepatic necrosis\r\n\r\nB) Amitriptyline \u2013 Can lead to anticholinergic effects, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias, not liver failure\r\n\r\nC) Amlodipine \u2013 Overdose causes hypotension and reflex tachycardia, no hepatic necrosis\r\n\r\nD) Bisoprolol \u2013 Beta-blocker toxicity can cause bradycardia and hypotension, not liver damage\r\n\r\nE) Citalopram \u2013 May cause serotonin syndrome and QT prolongation, not associated with hepatic necrosis\r\n\r\nF) Fentanyl \u2013 Causes respiratory depression and CNS effects, no liver involvement\r\n\r\nG) Naproxen \u2013 NSAID toxicity may cause renal issues and GI bleeding, not hepatic necrosis\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nParacetamol overdose is life threatening due to its risk of acute hepatic failure. It requires prompt treatment with acetylcysteine, ideally within 8 hours of ingestion, to prevent irreversible liver damage, encephalopathy, and death. Regular monitoring of ALT, INR, bilirubin, and renal function is essential in suspected toxicity cases.",

    "text": "A 40-year-old woman with a history of severe asthma and recurrent herpes simplex keratitis visits the pharmacy for a prescription of Xalatan (latanoprost) eye drops. She has been diagnosed with ocular hypertension and has been advised to use latanoprost once daily in the evening. She asks you about the possible side effects and precautions of using latanoprost.",
    "why": "E) Latanoprost should be stored in the refrigerator before opening and at room temperature after opening.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nAccording to the British National Formulary (BNF), Xalatan (latanoprost) eye drops should be stored at room temperature (not in the refrigerator) before and after opening. This is the correct guideline for Xalatan, although some generic versions of latanoprost may have different storage instructions, which may include refrigeration before opening.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options\r\n\r\nA) Latanoprost may cause eye irritation, increased eyelash growth, and changes in eye colour\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Common side effects of latanoprost include eye irritation, increased eyelash growth, and changes in iris colour, which can be permanent.\r\n\r\nB) Latanoprost should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis\r\n\r\nThis is true. Latanoprost should be used cautiously in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis, as it may trigger or worsen an outbreak, particularly in those with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis.\r\n\r\nC) Latanoprost should be avoided in patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Latanoprost can potentially exacerbate asthma in patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma, so it should be avoided in these cases.\r\n\r\nD) Latanoprost should be applied at least 15 minutes before or after wearing contact lenses\r\n\r\nThis is accurate. Latanoprost contains benzalkonium chloride, which can be absorbed by soft contact lenses and may cause irritation. It is recommended that latanoprost be applied at least 15 minutes before or after wearing contact lenses.\r\n\r\nLatanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue commonly used for the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. By increasing the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye, it effectively lowers intraocular pressure. NICE guidelines recommend latanoprost for managing these conditions, but they also advise caution in specific patient populations. For example, patients with a history of herpetic keratitis should be monitored closely, and it is generally avoided in patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma due to the potential for exacerbating symptoms. The guidelines also emphasize proper administration techniques to avoid potential side effects, such as eye irritation and changes in eye colour, and to ensure the safe use of contact lenses.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eyes):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nG) Paracetamol suspension\r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\r\nThe child has mild pain from a grazed knee, and the most suitable first-line analgesic in children is paracetamol.\r\n\r\n- Paracetamol is safe, well-tolerated, and effective for mild to moderate pain.\r\n\r\n- Paracetamol suspension is the preferred formulation for a 9-year-old child.\r\n\r\n- NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) should be avoided in children with asthma unless they have previously tolerated them.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Aspirin tablets \r\n\r\nAspirin is contraindicated in children under 16 years due to the risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome, a rare but serious condition affecting the liver and brain.\r\n\r\nB) Codeine liquid \r\n\r\nCodeine is not recommended in children under 12 years due to the risk of respiratory depression and variable metabolism.\r\n\r\nC) Diazepam tablets \r\n\r\nDiazepam is not an analgesic and is inappropriate for pain management.\r\n\r\nD) Diclofenac tablets \r\n\r\nNSAIDs like diclofenac should be avoided in children with asthma, as they can trigger bronchospasm.\r\n\r\n(E) Ibuprofen tablets \r\n\r\nAlthough ibuprofen is commonly used for pain relief, it should be avoided in children with asthma unless previous tolerance is confirmed.\r\n\r\nF) Naproxen tablets \r\n\r\nNaproxen is an NSAID, which may worsen asthma symptoms.\r\nIt is also not typically used for mild pain in children.\r\n\r\n\r\nH) Tramadol capsules \r\n\r\nTramadol is an opioid and is not recommended for mild pain in children.\r\n\r\nPain Management in Children with Asthma \r\n\r\n- Paracetamol is the first-line analgesic for children due to its safety and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) should be avoided in children with asthma, as they can trigger bronchospasm unless the child has previously tolerated them.\r\n\r\n- Aspirin is contraindicated in children under 16 years due to the risk of Reye\u2019s syndrome.\r\n\r\n- Opioids like codeine and tramadol are not recommended for mild pain in children due to the risk of respiratory depression.\r\n\r\nFor minor injuries like grazes or cuts, pain management should be combined with wound cleaning, antiseptic application, and reassurance. In most cases, paracetamol suspension provides effective relief without risk of asthma exacerbation.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Sciatica\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis patient presents with sharp, burning pain radiating down the left leg, which worsens with prolonged sitting or standing. This is a classic presentation of sciatica, a condition caused by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve, often due to lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5 or L5-S1.\r\n\r\nA positive Straight Leg Raise (SLR) test (pain reproduced when lifting the affected leg while lying down) is a key clinical finding in sciatica. The condition is often self-limiting, and treatment focuses on pain management, physiotherapy, and maintaining mobility.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: Hip osteoarthritis\r\n\r\nHip osteoarthritis causes gradual onset of joint stiffness and pain, typically worsened by movement but not radiating down the leg in a sharp, burning pattern.\r\n\r\nB: Muscular dystrophy\r\n\r\nMuscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness rather than acute onset radiating pain.\r\n\r\nC: Rheumatoid arthritis\r\n\r\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically affects multiple joints symmetrically, especially the small joints of the hands and feet, and does not usually present as unilateral lower back pain radiating to the leg.\r\n\r\nD: Sacroiliac joint dysfunction\r\n\r\nSacroiliac joint dysfunction can cause lower back pain, but it usually presents as localised pain in the sacroiliac region rather than sharp, burning pain radiating down the leg.\r\n\r\nSciatica is a common cause of lower back pain radiating down the leg, often due to lumbar disc herniation or nerve root compression. According to NICE NG59: Low Back Pain and Sciatica, first-line management includes analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs), physiotherapy, and maintaining physical activity. Opioids are not routinely recommended. In severe or persistent cases, referral for imaging (MRI) and specialist assessment may be required, particularly if there are red flag symptoms such as bladder dysfunction, saddle anaesthesia, or progressive weakness, which suggest cauda equina syndrome, a medical emergency.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF Lesson Chapter 10 (Musculoskeletal System) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "A Pharmacist needs to prepare 100ml of a 0.5% w/v solution of sodium chloride from a 10% w/v stock solution.",
    "why": "5 ml\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe pharmacist needs to prepare 100 ml of a 0.5% w/v sodium chloride solution from a 10% w/v stock solution. This requires a dilution calculation, which can be solved using the dilution formula:\r\n\r\nC1 \u00d7 V1 = C2 \u00d7 V2\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n\r\nC1 = 10% (stock solution concentration)\r\nV1 = ? (volume of stock solution required)\r\nC2 = 0.5% (final concentration needed)\r\nV2 = 100 ml (final total volume)\r\n\r\nRearrange the formula to solve for V1:\r\n\r\nV1 = (C2 \u00d7 V2) / C1\r\n\r\nV1 = (0.5 \u00d7 100) / 10\r\n\r\nV1 = 5 ml\r\n\r\nThus, the pharmacist should take 5 ml of the 10% stock solution and dilute it to a total volume of 100 ml with water.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA: 0.5 ml\r\n\r\nThis would result in a much lower final concentration (0.05% w/v) instead of the required 0.5% w/v, making it ineffective for the intended use.\r\n\r\nC: 10 ml\r\n\r\nThis would give a final concentration of 1% w/v, which is double the required concentration, leading to a hypertonic solution that may cause cellular dehydration if administered incorrectly.\r\n\r\nD: 50 ml\r\n\r\nThis would result in a final concentration of 5% w/v, which is ten times the required concentration, increasing the risk of hypernatremia and other osmotic imbalances.\r\n\r\nE: 100 ml\r\n\r\nThis would mean using 100 ml of the 10% stock solution without dilution, resulting in a 10% w/v solution instead of the required 0.5% w/v, making it far too concentrated for safe use.\r\n\r\nSodium Chloride Dilution \r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines (2025), sodium chloride solutions are used for fluid resuscitation, wound irrigation, nebulisation, and dilution of medications. The concentration of sodium chloride must be carefully controlled to prevent electrolyte imbalances and osmotic disturbances.\r\n\r\nA 0.5% w/v sodium chloride solution is commonly used in ophthalmic preparations, wound care, and respiratory therapy. Incorrect dilution can lead to hypertonic or hypotonic effects, potentially causing cellular dehydration or oedema. Healthcare professionals must ensure accurate preparation and verify concentrations before administration to prevent adverse patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nFor further details, refer to BNF Lesson 9: Nutrition & Fluids (IV Therapy & Electrolyte Balance) at:\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

She has no history of glaucoma or other eye diseases. She asks for your advice on what eye drops she can use to lower her IOP and prevent glaucoma.",
    "why": "D. Latanoprost\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nLatanoprost, a topical prostaglandin analogue, is recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment for reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) and preventing glaucoma. It is effective in lowering IOP and has a well-established safety profile for patients with elevated IOP but no other symptoms or complications. In cases where latanoprost is not tolerated, other prostaglandin analogues or beta-blockers like timolol can be used as alternatives.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Brimonidine\r\n\r\nThis is a sympathomimetic that can lower IOP by reducing the production of aqueous humor and increasing its outflow. However, it is not the first-line treatment due to its potential side effects, such as ocular irritation and dry mouth, and its limited efficacy compared to prostaglandin analogues.\r\n\r\nB. Cyclopentolate\r\n\r\nThis is an antimuscarinic used to induce pupil dilation for diagnostic purposes, not for lowering IOP. It is not used for glaucoma or elevated IOP.\r\n\r\nC. Dorzolamide\r\n\r\nThis is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used to reduce IOP, typically in combination with other treatments. It is second-line after prostaglandin analogues.\r\n\r\nE. Timolol\r\n\r\nThis is a beta-blocker used to reduce IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production. It is effective but typically used second-line after prostaglandin analogues, as they tend to be better tolerated and more effective in the long term.\r\n\r\nFor the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevention of glaucoma, prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost, are considered the first-line therapy due to their ability to reduce IOP effectively by enhancing aqueous humor outflow. They are preferred over other treatments like beta-blockers (e.g., timolol) or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., dorzolamide) because of their superior efficacy and lower incidence of systemic side effects. If prostaglandin analogues are not tolerated, other medications or surgical options may be considered, but latanoprost remains the preferred choice according to current clinical guidelines.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eyes):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You are running a smoking cessation service in your local community pharmacy",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Carbon monoxide monitoring\r\n\r\nRationale \r\n\r\nIn smoking cessation services, the most effective and objective way to monitor compliance and progress is through carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring.\r\n\r\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is a byproduct of tobacco combustion and is absorbed into the bloodstream when a person smokes.\r\n\r\nExhaled CO levels drop within 24 hours of smoking cessation, making it a reliable biomarker of smoking status.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends CO monitoring as a motivational tool to help patients see measurable progress when quitting smoking.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Carbon dioxide monitoring \r\n\r\nIncorrect, as carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) levels are not directly linked to smoking cessation. CO\u2082 is a natural byproduct of metabolism and does not serve as an indicator of smoking status.\r\n\r\nC) Monitoring of withdrawal symptoms \r\n\r\nWhile tracking withdrawal symptoms (e.g., cravings, irritability, anxiety) is useful in tailoring support, it is a subjective measure and does not confirm compliance.\r\n\r\nD) Nicotine replacement levels \r\n\r\nNot routinely measured, as nicotine pharmacokinetics vary between individuals. The focus of NICE smoking cessation guidelines is on reducing tobacco-related harm, not nicotine levels.\r\n\r\nE) Oxygen saturation levels in air \r\n\r\nOxygen saturation (SpO\u2082) is not a useful measure for smoking cessation. Chronic smokers may have normal oxygen saturation despite high CO levels, making this an unreliable marker of smoking status.\r\n\r\nGuidance on Smoking Cessation Monitoring\r\n\r\nSmoking cessation is a key public health priority due to its significant impact on reducing morbidity and mortality. \r\n\r\nAn effective smoking cessation programme should include:\r\n\r\n- Carbon monoxide (CO) breath testing \u2013 A validated tool to objectively assess smoking status and compliance.\r\n- Behavioural support and follow-ups \u2013 Regular one-to-one or group counselling improves success rates.\r\n- Pharmacological interventions \u2013 Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, or bupropion should be considered based on patient preference and suitability.\r\n- Personalised relapse prevention strategies \u2013 Addressing withdrawal symptoms and triggers helps reduce relapse risk.\r\n\r\nBy integrating objective CO monitoring with tailored behavioural and pharmacological support, community pharmacists can significantly improve smoking cessation success rates and reduce long-term health risks associated with smoking.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Contact the doctor to stop the tramadol\u200b\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTramadol is associated with an increased risk of seizures and should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy. Given that the patient is already prescribed codeine, another opioid analgesic, adding tramadol may not provide additional benefit and could increase the risk of adverse effects. Therefore, it is appropriate to contact the doctor to discontinue tramadol in this patient's analgesic regimen.\u200b\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Contact the doctor to add in gastro-protection \r\n\r\nWhile NSAIDs like ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal (GI) irritation, the need for gastro-protection should be evaluated based on individual risk factors such as age, history of GI ulcers, or concurrent use of other medications that increase GI risk. If the patient has no additional risk factors, routine gastro-protection may not be necessary.\u200b\r\n\r\nB) Contact the doctor to ensure you have a controlled drug (CD) prescription for the tramadol \r\n\r\nIn the UK, tramadol is classified as a Schedule 3 controlled drug, but it does not require the use of a controlled drug prescription form. However, certain prescription writing requirements must be met.\u200b\r\n\r\nC) Contact the doctor to stop the codeine \r\n\r\nCodeine is a commonly used opioid analgesic for moderate pain. There is no specific contraindication to its use in this patient, provided it is used appropriately.\u200b\r\n\r\n(E) Dispense the TTA ensuring that the patient has at least 7 days supply \r\n\r\nDispensing the take-home analgesia (TTA) as prescribed without addressing the potential risks associated with tramadol in a patient with epilepsy could lead to adverse outcomes.\u200b\r\n\r\nAnalgesic Use in Patients with Epilepsy:\r\n\r\nWhen prescribing analgesics to patients with epilepsy, it is crucial to consider the potential impact on seizure threshold. Tramadol has been associated with an increased risk of seizures and should be used with caution in this population. Alternative analgesics with a more favourable safety profile regarding seizure risk should be considered.\u200b\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 4 (Central Nervous System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) Co-trimoxazole\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nCo-trimoxazole is a sulfonamide antibiotic that can induce oxidative stress in red blood cells. Patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are at a higher risk of acute haemolytic anaemia because their red blood cells lack the ability to effectively neutralise oxidative damage. Co-trimoxazole is a well-documented trigger for haemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals and is contraindicated or should be used with extreme caution in these patients.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Aspirin\r\n\r\nAspirin in low doses is generally safe for G6PD-deficient patients, but high doses may contribute to oxidative stress and lead to haemolysis. However, it is not as strong a trigger as co-trimoxazole.\r\n\r\nC) Clonazepam\r\n\r\nClonazepam is a benzodiazepine used for epilepsy and anxiety and has no known risk of causing haemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients.\r\n\r\nD) Gliclazide\r\n\r\nGliclazide is a sulfonylurea used for diabetes management. While some sulfonylureas may have a mild oxidative effect, gliclazide is not classified as a high-risk drug for G6PD deficiency.\r\n\r\nE) Ibuprofen\r\n\r\nIbuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is generally safe for G6PD-deficient patients at normal doses. However, some NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid) pose a higher risk of haemolysis and should be used cautiously.\r\n\r\nG6PD Deficiency and Drug-Induced Haemolysis :\r\n\r\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked genetic disorder that affects the ability of red blood cells to withstand oxidative stress. Exposure to certain medications, infections, or foods (e.g., fava beans) can trigger acute haemolytic anaemia, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, pallor, fatigue, and shortness of breath.\r\n\r\nCertain drugs must be avoided in G6PD deficiency due to their oxidative potential, which can cause red blood cell destruction. High-risk medications include:\r\n\r\n- Sulfonamides (e.g., co-trimoxazole, dapsone)\r\n- Nitrofurantoin\r\n- Primaquine (antimalarial)\r\n- Quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin)\r\n- Certain NSAIDs (e.g., mefenamic acid)\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, it is essential to review medication history in G6PD-deficient patients before prescribing potential oxidative drugs. Where alternatives are available, lower-risk medications should be considered to prevent haemolysis.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "Whilst in hospital, the patient is referred to an ophthalmic specialist who initiates latanoprost 0.005% w/v eye drops at a dose of 1 drop into the left eye each day to help better manage his glaucoma.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nB) May cause harmless pigmentation of the iris\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue used to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. \r\n\r\n- A well-known side effect is increased brown pigmentation of the iris, especially in patients with mixed-colour irises (e.g., green-brown, blue-brown). This pigmentation is usually harmless and permanent but should be explained to the patient as it may change the appearance of the eye over time.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Best applied in the morning \r\n\r\nProstaglandin analogues like latanoprost are usually applied in the evening because intra-ocular pressure is often higher at night and they are more effective when dosed then.\r\n\r\nC) May be administered whilst wearing contact lens \r\n\r\nLatanoprost contains benzalkonium chloride, a preservative that can be absorbed by contact lenses and cause irritation. Contact lenses should be removed before use and can be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.\r\n\r\nD) Should be used 2 minutes apart from another eye drop \r\n\r\nWhen more than one eye drop is required, they should be spaced at least 5 minutes apart, not 2, to ensure proper absorption and avoid washout.\r\n\r\nE) Should not be used alongside timolol \r\n\r\nLatanoprost can be safely used with timolol (a beta-blocker eye drop) and in fact, combination products like latanoprost/timolol are available and commonly prescribed for better IOP control.\r\n\r\nLatanoprost Use in Glaucoma:\r\n\r\n- Latanoprost is a first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, reducing intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow. It is typically administered once daily at night. \r\n\r\n- One of the most important counselling points is that it can cause increased brown pigmentation of the iris, which is permanent but not harmful. \r\n\r\n- Patients should also be advised that it may cause mild stinging and should not be used while wearing contact lenses due to preservative absorption. \r\n\r\n- When using multiple eye drops, they should be spaced at least 5 minutes apart. Latanoprost is often used alone or in combination with timolol to achieve optimal pressure control.\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 11 (Eye):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "text": "You are a pharmacist working in a hospital ward. A 25-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis is admitted with an acute exacerbation of pulmonary infection. She is currently taking the following medicines:\r\nKaftrio 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg tablets, two tablets twice daily\r\nAzithromycin 250 mg capsules, one capsule three times a week\r\nAlbuterol inhaler, two puffs as needed\r\nHypertonic saline nebuliser, 4 ml twice daily\r\nDornase alfa nebuliser, 2.5 mg once daily\r\nPancreatin 25,000 units capsules, two capsules with each meal and one with snacks\r\nOmeprazole 20 mg tablets, one tablet daily\r\nCalcium carbonate 500 mg tablets, two tablets twice daily\r\nVitamin D3 800 IU tablets, one tablet daily\r\nYou review her sputum culture results and find that she has a chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is sensitive to colistin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin.",
    "why": "E) Colistin 2 million units every 8 hours plus ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines on cystic fibrosis, dual antibiotic therapy is preferred for treating acute pulmonary exacerbations caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rationale behind dual therapy is to use antibiotics with different mechanisms of action to optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of bacterial resistance.\r\n\r\nColistin is a polymyxin antibiotic that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, making it effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\r\nCiprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis, targeting the infection from a different angle.\r\nTogether, these antibiotics work synergistically and are often recommended in combination to treat serious infections in cystic fibrosis patients, especially those involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This regimen helps in achieving better bacterial eradication and preventing further resistance development.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Colistin 2 million units every 8 hours: While colistin is effective, the NICE guidelines recommend using two antibiotics to reduce resistance and improve treatment efficacy. Monotherapy is generally not preferred for acute infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\r\n\r\nB) Tobramycin 10 mg/kg once daily: Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside and can interact with Kaftrio (a CF medication) to increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Additionally, tobramycin is not recommended as the sole antibiotic in this case, as it would not meet the guidelines' recommendation for dual therapy.\r\n\r\nC) Ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours: Ciprofloxacin alone is insufficient for treating acute exacerbations of pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. Dual therapy is recommended for more effective treatment.\r\n\r\nD) Colistin 2 million units every 8 hours plus tobramycin 10 mg/kg once daily: This combination is not ideal, as both colistin and tobramycin are nephrotoxic and ototoxic. Using these two antibiotics together increases the risk of adverse effects, particularly kidney and hearing damage.\r\n\r\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that often leads to chronic pulmonary infections, particularly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Management of acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients involves the use of intravenous antibiotics with different mechanisms of action to target the infection effectively and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.\r\n\r\nAccording to NICE guidelines, a dual therapy approach with two intravenous antibiotics is preferred when treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients. This includes using antibiotics like colistin, a polymyxin that disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, and ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone that inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. The combination of these two antibiotics provides better clinical outcomes and reduces the chances of developing resistance compared to monotherapy.\r\n\r\nKey Points:\r\n\r\nColistin and ciprofloxacin are recommended as they have complementary mechanisms of action, ensuring comprehensive treatment.\r\nDual antibiotic therapy is recommended over monotherapy to prevent resistance and improve clinical outcomes.\r\nDoses and the choice of antibiotics should consider the patient's renal function and overall condition, as well as the potential for drug interactions, particularly with cystic fibrosis medications like Kaftrio.\r\nThe NICE guidelines advocate for careful monitoring of the patient\u2019s response to treatment, adjustment of doses as necessary, and use of dual therapy to avoid complications like nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.\r\n\r\nFor further reading, you can consult the NICE Guidelines on Cystic Fibrosis for detailed recommendations on management and treatment protocols.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please watch BNF lesson Chapter 5 (Infections):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "50 IU/kg three times a week\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a patient with chronic renal failure and symptomatic anaemia undergoing haemodialysis, the SmPC for Eprex recommends an initial starting dose of 50 IU/kg three times weekly during the correction phase. This regimen ensures an effective response to treatment by promoting erythropoiesis while avoiding overtreatment, which could lead to complications such as hypertension or thromboembolic events.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 50 IU/kg twice weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is lower than the recommended frequency for haemodialysis patients. It may result in suboptimal correction of anaemia during the initial treatment phase.\r\n\r\nB. 75 IU/kg three times weekly\r\n\r\nAlthough this higher dose could be used in certain cases, it exceeds the standard starting dose for patients undergoing haemodialysis and may increase the risk of adverse effects.\r\n\r\nC. 100 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nA once-weekly regimen is not appropriate during the correction phase, as more frequent dosing (three times weekly) is required to achieve target haemoglobin levels effectively.\r\n\r\nD. 150 IU/kg once every two weeks\r\n\r\nThis infrequent dosing schedule is unsuitable for correction phase treatment. Maintenance regimens can use longer intervals, but the correction phase requires regular dosing to achieve rapid results.\r\n\r\nE. 300 IU/kg once every four weeks\r\n\r\nThis dose is intended for different indications or as a maintenance dose in select cases. It is not suitable for patients in the correction phase of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure.\r\n\r\nF. 450 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is higher than required for the correction phase and is not aligned with the SmPC-recommended dosing for haemodialysis patients.\r\n\r\nG. 600 IU/kg once weekly\r\n\r\nThis dose is excessive and may be considered for alternative scenarios or unresponsive patients, but it is not the standard starting dose for haemodialysis-associated anaemia correction.\r\n\r\nNICE recommends the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), like epoetin alpha, for the management of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those undergoing haemodialysis. The treatment aim is to maintain haemoglobin levels within the target range of 10\u201312 g/dL. Careful monitoring is essential to avoid overcorrection, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events.\r\n\r\nFor correction-phase treatment, NICE aligns with the dosing guidance provided by the SmPC, recommending frequent administration (e.g., three times weekly) to restore haemoglobin levels effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Blood and Nutrition):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/preview-question/2432",

    "text": "The patient is currently taking ramipril 2.5mg BD, metaprolol, furosemide 40mg OD and simvastatin. Over the past few days their potassium levels have been decreasing and the prescribers wish to initiate another diuretic. Their current potassium is 3.1mcg/L (normal range 3.5 \u2013 5.1mcg/L) and their eGFR is 57mL/min.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nE) Spironolactone\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient has hypokalaemia (potassium 3.1 mcg/L, normal range 3.5 \u2013 5.1 mcg/L) and requires a diuretic that will not exacerbate potassium loss. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, meaning it helps retain potassium and can counteract the potassium-lowering effects of furosemide, a loop diuretic known to promote potassium excretion. Given that the patient\u2019s eGFR is 57 mL/min, spironolactone can be safely used; however, it should be prescribed with caution in individuals with worsening renal function due to the risk of hyperkalaemia. \r\nRegular monitoring of potassium and renal function is necessary, particularly because the patient is also on an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), which can increase potassium levels when combined with spironolactone.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Bendroflumethiazide\r\n\r\nBendroflumethiazide is not appropriate as it is a thiazide diuretic, which can increase potassium excretion and worsen the patient\u2019s existing hypokalaemia. Thiazide diuretics are also less effective when eGFR falls below 30 mL/min. Although this patient's eGFR is 57 mL/min, spironolactone is still the better choice to address the low potassium levels.\r\n\r\nB) Bumetanide\r\n\r\nBumetanide is a loop diuretic, similar to furosemide, which enhances potassium excretion. Using bumetanide alongside furosemide would further lower potassium levels, putting the patient at increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This makes bumetanide an inappropriate choice for this patient.\r\n\r\nC) Indapamide\r\n\r\nIndapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic, which can contribute to potassium loss and worsen hypokalaemia. Although indapamide is sometimes used for hypertension, it is not suitable for a patient who already has low potassium levels and is taking another potassium-lowering diuretic (furosemide).\r\n\r\nD) Mannitol\r\n\r\nMannitol is an osmotic diuretic, used mainly for cerebral oedema and acute kidney injury prevention rather than for routine diuresis. It does not play a role in managing fluid retention, heart failure, or hypertension and is therefore an inappropriate option in this scenario.\r\n\r\nE) Spironolactone\r\n\r\nSpironolactone is the correct answer because it is a potassium-sparing diuretic, meaning it prevents excessive potassium loss while still helping with fluid retention. It is especially beneficial in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or those at risk of further hypokalaemia. \r\nHowever, it must be used cautiously in patients with eGFR <45 mL/min due to the risk of hyperkalaemia, so potassium and renal function should be monitored regularly.\r\n\r\nDiuretics and Potassium Balance:\r\n\r\nDiuretics are commonly used to manage hypertension, heart failure, and fluid retention, but their effects on potassium balance must be carefully considered. \r\nLoop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide cause significant potassium loss, increasing the risk of hypokalaemia, which can lead to arrhythmias and muscle weakness. \r\nSimilarly, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics such as bendroflumethiazide and indapamide also promote potassium excretion, making them unsuitable choices in patients with existing hypokalaemia. \r\nIn contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone and eplerenone help retain potassium by blocking aldosterone, which prevents excessive potassium excretion in the kidneys. \r\nHowever, these agents must be used with caution in patients with renal impairment, as they increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. \r\nNICE guidelines recommend monitoring serum potassium and renal function regularly in patients prescribed potassium-sparing diuretics, particularly if co-prescribed with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as these also increase potassium levels.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 2 (Cardiovascular System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nC) Pernicious Anaemia\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe patient's low haemoglobin (110 g/L) and elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 110 fL indicate macrocytic anaemia. The key findings that support vitamin B12 deficiency are:\r\n\r\n- Severely low B12 level (97 ng/L, normal: 200\u2013800 ng/L)\r\n- Normal ferritin (50 ng/L, normal: 20\u2013200 ng/L), ruling out iron-deficiency anaemia\r\n- Low folate (4 ng/L, normal: 3\u201313 ng/L)\r\n\r\nThe most likely cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anaemia, an autoimmune condition that leads to impaired absorption of B12 due to intrinsic factor deficiency.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Haemoglobinopathy \r\n\r\nHaemoglobinopathies (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassaemia) typically present with microcytic anaemia (low MCV) rather than macrocytosis.\r\n\r\n(B) Methaemoglobinaemia \r\n\r\nMethaemoglobinaemia is a functional haemoglobin disorder where oxygen delivery is impaired, leading to cyanosis and hypoxia. It does not cause macrocytic anaemia.\r\n\r\n(D) Sickle Cell Anaemia \r\n\r\nSickle cell anaemia is a genetic haemoglobinopathy that presents with normocytic or microcytic anaemia, not macrocytosis.\r\n\r\n(E) Thalassaemia \r\n\r\nInherited disorder affecting haemoglobin synthesis. It causes microcytic anaemia (low MCV), which contradicts the patient\u2019s high MCV.\r\n\r\nPernicious Anaemia \r\n\r\nPernicious anaemia is a leading cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to macrocytic anaemia and neurological complications if untreated.\r\n\r\nNICE 2025 recommends the following approach:\r\n\r\n- Diagnosis: Confirmed by low B12 levels and positive intrinsic factor/parietal cell antibodies.\r\n\r\nTreatment:\r\n\r\n- Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM three times a week for two weeks.\r\n\r\n- Maintenance: 1 mg IM every three months for life if pernicious anaemia is confirmed.\r\n\r\n- Oral cyanocobalamin is not recommended for pernicious anaemia due to malabsorption.\r\n\r\n- Folic acid supplementation: Only after B12 correction, if folate deficiency is also present.\r\n\r\n- Monitoring: Regular full blood count (FBC) and neurological assessment to ensure adequate response.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch BNF lesson Chapter 9 (Nutrition and Blood):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\n1250 mL\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the provided table in the resource, fluid maintenance therapy is weight-dependent. For a child weighing 10\u201315 kg, the recommended daily fluid intake is 1.25 L/day (1250 mL). This ensures adequate hydration before and after pamidronate infusion, reducing the risk of nephrotoxicity and other complications associated with bisphosphonate therapy.\r\n\r\nPamidronate is a bisphosphonate used in paediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) to reduce bone fragility and improve bone density. It is administered via IV infusion and requires careful monitoring due to potential renal complications. Adequate hydration before and after infusion is crucial to prevent nephrotoxicity, a known adverse effect of bisphosphonates. NICE guidelines recommend optimising fluid balance and electrolyte status to minimise the risk of renal impairment. Additionally, calcium supplementation is required to prevent hypocalcaemia following bisphosphonate therapy. Monitoring of renal function, serum calcium, and vitamin D levels is advised throughout treatment.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch BNF lesson Chapter 6 (Endocrine System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",

    "why": "Correct answer: \r\n\r\nE. Vitamin B1\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is a serious neurological emergency caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, commonly seen in patients with chronic alcohol misuse. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Without prompt treatment, it can progress to Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome, causing irreversible memory damage. High-dose parenteral thiamine (e.g. Pabrinex\u00ae) is required urgently to prevent permanent neurological impairment.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Calcium\r\n\r\nUsed in cases like hypocalcaemia, osteoporosis, or post-parathyroidectomy. Not relevant to Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.\r\n\r\nB. Iron\r\n\r\nTreats iron-deficiency anaemia. Although alcoholics may have anaemia, this is not the cause of the acute neurological picture.\r\n\r\nC. Folic acid\r\n\r\nCan be deficient in alcoholism but does not cause Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy and is not the immediate treatment priority.\r\n\r\nD. Magnesium\r\n\r\nOften co-administered with thiamine in alcohol misuse because magnesium deficiency can impair thiamine utilisation, but it is not the primary treatment for Wernicke\u2019s.\r\n\r\nF. Vitamin B12\r\n\r\nDeficiency leads to peripheral neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, not Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy.\r\n\r\nG. Vitamin D\r\n\r\nDeficiency is common in alcoholics but related to bone health, not neurological emergencies.\r\n\r\nH. Zinc\r\n\r\nMay be depleted in chronic alcohol use, but again not involved in acute neurological syndromes like Wernicke\u2019s.\r\n\r\n\r\nWernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is a medical emergency caused by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency, especially in patients with chronic alcohol dependence. Prompt IV thiamine is essential to prevent progression to Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome, which causes irreversible cognitive damage. Oral supplementation is insufficient in acute cases.",

    "text": "A 33-year-old with rheumatoid arthritis is also started on a drug at the same time as her methotrexate prescription to help limit its side effect profile.",
    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\n(B) Folic Acid\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nMethotrexate is a first-line disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While effective, it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to folate deficiency, which can cause side effects such as mucosal ulcers, gastrointestinal discomfort, hepatotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the risk of methotrexate-induced side effects, NICE recommends that all patients prescribed methotrexate should also receive folic acid supplementation (typically 5 mg once weekly, taken on a different day from methotrexate). This helps replenish folate stores and minimise toxicity.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Artificial Saliva \r\n\r\nUsed for patients with xerostomia (dry mouth), commonly seen in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, but it does not counteract methotrexate toxicity.\r\n\r\n(C) Folinic Acid \r\n\r\nA more potent form of folate, used as a methotrexate antidote in cases of overdose or severe toxicity but not routinely given for methotrexate side effect prevention.\r\n\r\n(D) Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) \r\n\r\nUsed to prevent isoniazid-induced neuropathy but does not play a significant role in managing methotrexate toxicity.\r\n\r\n(E) Zinc Lozenges \r\n\r\nUsed for cold symptom relief and immune function support, with no role in preventing methotrexate toxicity.\r\n\r\nMethotrexate and Folic Acid Supplementation \r\n\r\nMethotrexate is a widely used DMARD for treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and other autoimmune conditions. Folic acid supplementation is essential to reduce the risk of adverse effects while maintaining the drug\u2019s efficacy.\r\n\r\nThe recommended regimen is 5 mg folic acid once weekly, taken on a different day than methotrexate.\r\nMonitoring includes regular full blood counts (FBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function tests to detect early toxicity.\r\n\r\nPatients must be advised to avoid live vaccines and alcohol due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.\r\n\r\nFor more information, watch BNF lesson Chapter 10 ( Musculoskeletal System):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/bnf-course",
