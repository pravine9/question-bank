Legal labelling requirements for medicinal products are strictly outlined in law and focus on patient safety and traceability.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\na) Date of dispensing\r\n\r\nThis is a legal requirement to ensure traceability and patient safety. The date of dispensing indicates when the medicine was prepared and supplied, helping with accountability and monitoring medication use.\r\n\r\nc) Name of medicine\r\n\r\nLegally required to identify the product being dispensed. It ensures patients and healthcare providers can accurately determine the specific medication and formulation.\r\n\r\nd) Patient name\r\n\r\nIncluding the patient\u2019s name on the label is a legal requirement to personalise the medicine and prevent confusion or misuse.\r\n\r\ne) Precautions relating to the medical product\r\n\r\nPrecautionary information such as storage conditions or usage warnings (e.g., \"Store below 25\u00b0C\" or \"Take with food\") is legally required to ensure safe and effective use of the medication.\r\n\r\nLabelling of medicinal products is governed by the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 to promote safe and effective use of medicines while ensuring traceability and reducing the risk of misuse. Essential elements that must appear on the label include:\r\n\r\nThe patient\u2019s name for personalisation and accountability.\r\nThe name of the medicine and its strength for clarity.\r\nThe date of dispensing to monitor the timeline of use.\r\nDirections for use to ensure proper administration.\r\nPrecautionary information such as storage conditions or warnings.\r\nWhile \"Keep out of reach and sight of children\" is not a legal requirement, it is a highly recommended practice to further safeguard patients, especially in homes with young children. Pharmacists must ensure compliance with these legal requirements while incorporating best practices to enhance patient safety and adherence.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "D. Record in Patient\u2019s Controlled Drug return register and denature the medication in adequate time without a witness if necessary.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, patient-returned Schedule 2 Controlled Drugs (such as MST, which contains morphine) must be denatured before disposal. These returns do not require an authorised witness (this is only mandatory for the disposal of expired stock from the pharmacy\u2019s Controlled Drug register).\r\n\r\nPatient returns should be recorded in the Patient\u2019s Controlled Drug Return register, and denaturing should be performed in a reasonable timeframe to prevent misuse. While it is ideal to have another staff member as a witness for transparency, this is not a legal requirement.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. Denature the medication straight away once you have contacted another pharmacist to witness the process.\r\nThis is incorrect. While it is good practice to have a witness when denaturing controlled drugs, it is not mandatory for patient-returned Schedule 2 CDs. Contacting another pharmacist unnecessarily delays the process.\r\n\r\nB. Dispose of it in the medicines bin immediately as patient-controlled drug returns do not require denaturing.\r\nThis is incorrect. Even though patient returns do not require an authorised witness, Schedule 2 CDs must still be denatured before disposal to prevent potential misuse.\r\n\r\nC. Record in Patient\u2019s Controlled Drug return register and contact another pharmacist to witness the denature.\r\nThis is incorrect. Although it is good practice to have another staff member as a witness, it is not a legal requirement. Requiring another pharmacist is unnecessary and may delay the disposal process.\r\n\r\nE. Record the return in the pharmacy\u2019s Controlled Drug register and denature the MST in adequate time.\r\nThis is incorrect because patient returns are recorded in the Patient\u2019s Controlled Drug Return register, not the pharmacy\u2019s Controlled Drug register. The latter is reserved for controlled drug stock held by the pharmacy.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPatient returns of Schedule 2 Controlled Drugs, such as MST (morphine), must be denatured before disposal to ensure safety and prevent misuse. These returns are recorded in the Patient\u2019s Controlled Drug Return register and do not require an authorised witness for disposal. While it is good practice to have another staff member as a witness, this is not a legal requirement. Denaturing should occur in a timely manner, following proper protocols, and the denatured material should be disposed of in the appropriate pharmaceutical waste container.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "There are different categories of veterinary medicines",
    "why": "(b) AVM - P\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe category AVM - P is not a recognized category of veterinary medicines. Veterinary medicines in the UK are classified into four main categories to regulate their supply, ensuring proper administration and animal safety.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) AVM - GSL (Authorised Veterinary Medicine - General Sales List): These medicines are available for sale without a prescription and can be purchased by the public without veterinary involvement.\r\n\r\n(c) NFA - VPS (Non-Food Animal - Veterinarian, Pharmacist, Suitably Qualified Person): These medicines are for non-food-producing animals and can be supplied by a veterinarian, pharmacist, or suitably qualified person.\r\n\r\n(d) POM - V (Prescription Only Medicine - Veterinarian): These medicines require a prescription from a veterinarian and are dispensed by a veterinarian or pharmacist.\r\n\r\n(e) POM - VPS (Prescription Only Medicine - Veterinarian, Pharmacist, Suitably Qualified Person): These are prescription medicines for food-producing animals and require a prescription by one of these three qualified professionals.\r\n\r\nThe Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMR) define these categories to ensure responsible use based on animal type, professional supervision, and public health. Each category has its specific criteria, ranging from medicines available to the general public (AVM - GSL) to those restricted to veterinary prescription (POM - V). The categories support safe supply chains, promote animal welfare, and reduce the risk of misuse in food-producing and companion animals.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Small military medical centres can outsource their dispensing to designated community pharmacies.",
    "why": "a) Military prescriptions do not have a designated prescription form\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nMilitary prescriptions do have a designated prescription form known as FMed 296. This form is used by military medical centres and is specific to prescriptions issued within the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The statement that military prescriptions do not have a designated form is therefore incorrect.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\nb) Military prescriptions presented to a non-contracted pharmacy should be treated as private prescriptions\r\n\r\nThis is correct. If a pharmacy does not have a contract with the MOD and is presented with a military prescription (e.g., FMed 296), it must treat the prescription as a private prescription. The patient will pay for the medication and can subsequently claim reimbursement from the MOD.\r\n\r\nc) Non-contracted pharmacies charge the patient for an appropriate fee\r\n\r\nThis is correct. When a military prescription is handled by a non-contracted pharmacy, the pharmacy charges the patient as they would for any private prescription.\r\n\r\nd) Pharmacies with a dispensing contract directly invoice the military of defence\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Pharmacies with a dispensing contract with the MOD are reimbursed directly by the MOD for the prescriptions they dispense.\r\n\r\ne) Prescriptions for Schedule 2 and 3 Controlled Drugs must be written on FP10PCD or equivalent\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Controlled Drugs (CDs) in Schedules 2 and 3 must be written on the appropriate designated form (e.g., FP10PCD or an MOD-equivalent prescription form) to meet legal requirements for dispensing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary prescriptions are issued on the designated FMed 296 form. Military sites often have dispensing doctors, but where this is not available, community pharmacies may be used to dispense medicines.\r\n\r\nContracted pharmacies: Pharmacies with a contract with the MOD invoice the MOD directly for reimbursement.\r\nNon-contracted pharmacies: If the pharmacy does not have a contract, prescriptions should be treated as private prescriptions, and the patient is charged accordingly. The patient can then seek reimbursement from the MOD.\r\nControlled Drugs: Prescriptions for Schedule 2 and 3 Controlled Drugs must comply with the legal requirements for CDs, including being written on an FP10PCD or equivalent designated form.\r\nPharmacists must be aware of these distinctions to ensure compliance with MOD requirements and the Human Medicines Regulations.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

A signed order from the school\u2019s head teacher or principal suffices, permitting the pharmacist to dispense the medication under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Advise the nurse to return to the school and get a prescription:\r\nIncorrect. A prescription from a doctor is not necessary; a signed order from the head teacher or principal is adequate.\r\n\r\n(B) Contact the head teacher to discuss the order:\r\nUnnecessary if the signed order complies with legal requirements for supplying AAIs to schools.\r\n\r\n(D) Refuse to dispense the medication as it\u2019s not a prescription from a doctor:\r\nIncorrect. Government regulations permit schools to use a signed order rather than a doctor\u2019s prescription in this case.\r\n\r\n(E) Treat it as a private prescription:\r\nIncorrect. The signed order doesn\u2019t need to be treated as a private prescription. However, an entry should be made in the prescription register for record-keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, schools in the UK are permitted to purchase AAIs for emergency anaphylaxis treatment based on a signed order from the head teacher or principal. This provision ensures rapid access to life-saving medication, especially for children who may have undiagnosed allergies. The pharmacist can supply the requested AAIs on receipt of a signed order, which must include the product details, quantity, and be authorised by the head teacher. Following the supply, pharmacists must log the transaction in the prescription register to comply with record-keeping requirements, enhancing accountability and ensuring the availability of emergency anaphylaxis treatment in school settings.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson Chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "c) Schedule 3 and 4 Controlled drugs are repeatable on private prescriptions\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nSchedule 3 Controlled Drugs are not repeatable on private prescriptions, as per the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. However, Schedule 4 (Part I and II) and Schedule 5 Controlled Drugs are repeatable. The distinction between repeatable and non-repeatable Controlled Drugs is vital for pharmacists to ensure compliance with legal requirements.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\na) If the number of repeats is not stated on a repeatable private prescription then you can dispense it twice\r\n\r\nThis is correct. If a repeatable prescription does not specify the number of repeats, it can be dispensed once initially and once more (total of two dispensings).\r\n\r\nb) Private prescriptions are repeatable\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Private prescriptions can be repeatable unless restricted by the type of medication (e.g., Schedule 2 and 3 Controlled Drugs).\r\n\r\nd) The first dispensing of prescription-only medication and Schedule 5 Controlled drugs must be within 6 months of the appropriate date\r\n\r\nThis is correct. The \"appropriate date\" is either the date the prescription was signed or a later date stated by the prescriber. For most medicines, including Schedule 5 Controlled Drugs, the first dispensing must occur within 6 months.\r\n\r\ne) The first dispensing of Schedule 4 Controlled drugs must be within 28 days of the appropriate date\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Schedule 4 Controlled Drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) must be dispensed for the first time within 28 days of the appropriate date.\r\n\r\nRepeatable prescriptions allow certain medicines to be dispensed more than once without issuing a new prescription. \r\n\r\nKey points include:\r\n\r\nPrivate prescriptions: These may be repeatable unless they involve Schedule 2 or 3 Controlled Drugs, which are not legally repeatable.\r\nNumber of repeats: If unspecified, prescriptions can be dispensed twice (initial plus one repeat).\r\nControlled Drugs:\r\nSchedule 2 and 3: Not repeatable.\r\nSchedule 4 and 5: Repeatable.\r\nDispensing timelines:\r\nSchedule 4 Controlled Drugs: First dispensing must occur within 28 days.\r\nPrescription-only medicines and Schedule 5: First dispensing must occur within 6 months.\r\nPharmacists must carefully assess prescription details to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

While the date of birth may be included in practice, especially to avoid confusion with similarly named patients, it is not a mandatory field under the regulations. However, if the patient is under 12 years of age, the age of the patient must be included on the prescription.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\nb) Date of prescription\r\n\r\nThe date of prescription is a legal requirement. It must be included on the prescription to determine the validity period and ensure that the prescription is within the allowed timeframe for dispensing.\r\n\r\nc) Particulars of prescriber\r\n\r\nThe particulars of the prescriber (such as their name, address, and professional qualification) are legally required. This ensures that the prescription is legitimate and traceable to the prescriber.\r\n\r\nd) Patient name and address\r\n\r\nThe patient's name and address are legally required to identify the recipient of the prescribed medication. This is essential for the correct dispensation of the medication.\r\n\r\ne) Signature by appropriate practitioner\r\n\r\nExplanation: The signature of the appropriate practitioner (the prescriber) is a legal requirement to verify the authenticity of the prescription.\r\nSummary on Legal Requirements for Prescriptions\r\nRegulation 217 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 sets out clear legal requirements for prescriptions to ensure safety and proper dispensing. These include the date of prescription, details of the prescriber, patient's name and address, and the signature of the appropriate practitioner.\r\nWhile the date of birth is not mandatory, the age of a patient under 12 years is a legal requirement. Ensuring that these elements are present helps maintain legal compliance, traceability, and patient safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "There has been tighter controls of over the counter medicines containing codeine",
    "why": "d) Pack sizes containing 48 unit doses are licensed as a pharmacy medicine.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe maximum pack size for codeine-containing medicines classified as pharmacy (P) medicines is 32 unit doses. A pack containing 48 unit doses exceeds this limit and would not qualify as a pharmacy medicine. Larger pack sizes are classified as prescription-only medicines (POM) to help mitigate the risks of misuse and dependency associated with codeine.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\na) Codeine-containing medications are licensed for short-term acute and moderate pain.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Codeine-containing OTC medicines are indicated for short-term acute moderate pain when alternative pain relief, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, alone is insufficient.\r\n\r\nb) Codeine-containing medicine is licensed for 3 days' use only.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. The use of codeine-containing medicines is limited to 3 days, and longer use increases the risk of addiction and dependence.\r\n\r\nc) Indications for cold and flu have been removed.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Licences for OTC codeine have removed indications such as cold and flu symptoms because evidence suggests they do not provide significant relief for these conditions while posing a risk of addiction.\r\n\r\ne) The warning \"Can cause addiction\" must be prominently displayed on the packaging.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Labelling regulations require all OTC medicines containing codeine to display a clear and prominent addiction warning to inform patients of the risks of misuse.\r\n\r\nCodeine-containing OTC medicines are tightly controlled to reduce the risks of dependency and misuse. These products are only approved for short-term acute moderate pain relief, with a usage limit of 3 days. Indications for less severe conditions like cold and flu have been removed, and the maximum pack size for pharmacy medicines is 32 unit doses. Larger pack sizes are classified as prescription-only medicines. Packaging must include warnings to inform patients about the potential for addiction. Pharmacists are responsible for providing counselling to ensure safe and appropriate use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "D. Being witness to a culture of bullying within the organisation.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nWhistleblowing involves raising concerns about serious wrongdoing or risks within an organisation that affect patient care, staff wellbeing, or public safety. NHS staff are encouraged to report incidents such as:\r\n\r\nUnsafe practices or care that could harm patients.\r\nA culture of bullying or harassment.\r\nFraud or financial malpractice.\r\nBreaches of confidentiality or laws.\r\nA culture of bullying can negatively impact staff morale, retention, and the quality of patient care, making it a legitimate and serious concern for whistleblowing.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. A member of staff who consistently turns up late to work.\r\nThis issue is related to individual performance and should be addressed through standard HR processes, not whistleblowing.\r\n\r\nB. An organisational restructure that has put your job at risk.\r\nConcerns about job security during a restructure should be raised through internal channels like unions or grievance processes, not whistleblowing.\r\n\r\nC. A patient who complains about receiving generic atorvastatin tablets.\r\nA patient\u2019s complaint regarding generic medication substitution is a common and individual concern. It does not meet the threshold for whistleblowing, which addresses systemic or organisational issues.\r\n\r\nE. Hearing two colleagues at work gossiping about another colleague.\r\nWorkplace gossip, while unprofessional, is not typically serious enough to warrant whistleblowing. Such issues should be resolved informally or through workplace conduct policies.\r\n\r\nWhistleblowing addresses serious organisational issues that can affect patient safety, staff wellbeing, or public confidence in NHS services. Witnessing a culture of bullying is a valid reason for whistleblowing, as it can harm employees and compromise the quality of care. NHS guidelines and policies encourage staff to report such concerns in a safe and supported manner. For other matters like lateness, job insecurity, or unprofessional behaviour, appropriate alternative routes such as HR or management intervention should be used.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson Chapter 5 (Appendices):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep\r\n\r\nFor more information on the topic also watch: \r\n\r\nhttps://improvement.nhs.uk/uploads/documents/whistleblowing_policy_final.pdf",

    "why": "(E) The prescription meets all legal requirements therefore dispense the remainder of the prescription.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSince the prescription includes the note \u201cPPP exempt,\u201d it indicates that the patient is not required to follow the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP), likely because of specific individual circumstances discussed with the prescriber. As a result, the remaining capsules can be dispensed without requiring an additional pregnancy test or new prescription. The prescription meets all necessary legal requirements, and the patient is permitted to collect the remainder of her medication.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Advise the patient to return to their GP for a new prescription:\r\nIncorrect. This is unnecessary, as the current prescription remains valid, and the note \"PPP exempt\" indicates the patient is not subject to PPP requirements.\r\n\r\n(B) Contact the GP surgery to specify which brand of isotretinoin is required:\r\nIncorrect. There is no indication in the scenario that the brand needs clarification or has caused issues. Therefore, contacting the GP about brand specification is irrelevant here.\r\n\r\n(C) Provide an emergency supply and request a new prescription from the GP:\r\nIncorrect. An emergency supply is not required because the prescription remains legally valid, and the PPP exemption allows for continued dispensing as directed.\r\n\r\n(D) Request a negative pregnancy test prior to dispensing:\r\nIncorrect. The \u201cPPP exempt\u201d notation on the prescription confirms that the patient does not require a negative pregnancy test prior to dispensing, as she is exempt from PPP requirements.\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin prescriptions for women of childbearing potential are generally subject to the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, which includes monthly pregnancy tests and strict dispensing intervals. However, a prescriber may determine that a patient is exempt from PPP requirements if clinically justified, which should be clearly noted on the prescription (e.g., \"PPP exempt\"). In such cases, as long as the prescription remains valid, the remainder of the medication can be dispensed without additional PPP-related checks, ensuring adherence to patient-specific directives and legal requirements.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch the MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "E. Make a record in the controlled drug return register, but there is no need for an authorised witness.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidance, fentanyl patches are Schedule 2 Controlled Drugs (CDs). For patient-returned CDs, the following rules apply:\r\n\r\nA record of the return should be made in a CD return register (not the controlled drug register used for stock).\r\nDestruction of patient-returned CDs does not require an authorised witness but should ideally be carried out in the presence of another member of staff (e.g., another pharmacist or a pharmacy team member) to ensure accountability.\r\nThe patches must be denatured before disposal using an appropriate CD destruction kit to render them irretrievable.\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. Make no record, and there is no need for an authorised witness.\r\nThis is incorrect because the receipt and destruction of returned Schedule 2 CDs must always be recorded in the CD return register to maintain an auditable trail.\r\n\r\nB. Make a record in the controlled drug register and have an authorised witness witness the destruction of the patches.\r\nThis is incorrect because the CD register is only for recording CD stock held in the pharmacy, not patient returns. Additionally, an authorised witness is only required for the destruction of expired pharmacy stock, not for patient-returned CDs.\r\n\r\nC. Make a record in the controlled drug register, but there is no need for an authorised witness.\r\nThis is incorrect because the CD register is not the correct place to record patient returns; the CD return register should be used instead.\r\n\r\nD. Make a record in your prescription register and have an authorised witness witness the destruction of the patches.\r\nThis is incorrect because the prescription register is for recording private prescriptions and supplies of certain CDs, not for the return and destruction of CDs.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nPatient returns of Schedule 2 Controlled Drugs, such as fentanyl patches, must be handled with care to ensure compliance with legal and professional standards. These returns should be recorded in the CD return register, and the medicines must be safely denatured before disposal. While an authorised witness is not required for patient-returned CDs, it is best practice to have another member of staff present during the destruction process to maintain accountability. Following these steps helps to prevent misuse and ensures the secure management of Controlled Drugs.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "a) Levonorgestrel is licensed for women over the age of 16 for emergency contraception within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel 1.5mg, when sold over-the-counter (OTC), is licensed for women aged 16 years and above. It is used as an emergency contraceptive within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI) or contraceptive failure.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\nb) Pharmacists cannot provide advanced emergency hormonal contraception in case of contraceptive failure.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Pharmacists can provide advanced supplies of emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) to women under certain circumstances, such as anticipated contraceptive failure. The pharmacist must ensure the patient is competent and will use the medication appropriately.\r\n\r\nc) Ulipristal acetate cannot be sold to those under the age of 16.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) can be supplied to patients under 16 years of age, provided the pharmacist assesses the patient for competence under the Fraser guidelines.\r\n\r\nd) Ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is available as 5mg tablets.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) is available as a single 30mg tablet for emergency contraception and must be taken within 120 hours (5 days) of UPSI.\r\n\r\ne) Ulipristal acetate is licensed for those over the age of 16 within 4 days of unprotected sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) is licensed for use in all reproductive-age women, including those under 16, and is effective for up to 5 days (120 hours) after UPSI.\r\n\r\nPharmacists can supply levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception, adhering to specific guidelines:\r\n\r\nLevonorgestrel: Licensed for women aged 16+ for use within 72 hours (3 days) of UPSI.\r\nUlipristal acetate (EllaOne): Licensed for use in all reproductive-age women (including under 16) within 120 hours (5 days) of UPSI.\r\nAdvanced supply: Permissible after assessing patient competency and ensuring appropriate use.\r\nPharmacists must counsel patients on proper use, efficacy timelines, and additional contraception measures to ensure optimal outcomes. \r\nNICE and MEP guidelines stress the importance of accessibility, safety, and patient-centred care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(d) Refuse to dispense the prescription as it is not on a standardised form.\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n\r\nGabapentin is classified as a Schedule 3 controlled drug, which requires it to be prescribed on a standardised, approved form (such as the pink FP10PCD) to meet legal requirements for dispensing. The prescription provided does not meet this requirement, so dispensing is not permitted.\r\n\r\nRegarding other criteria:\r\n\r\nThe prescription is not out of date. For Schedule 3 controlled drugs, prescriptions remain valid for 28 days from the date on the prescription. \r\nSince today\u2019s date is 28th December, the prescription would remain valid until the following day, 29th December.\r\nThe quantity is correctly written in both words and figures, meaning no amendment is necessary.\r\nEmergency supply is not allowed for Schedule 3 controlled drugs (except for phenobarbital in the treatment of epilepsy), so an emergency supply cannot be provided in this case.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(a) Advise the patient to return to their consultant for a new prescription as it is out of date \u2013 Incorrect, as the prescription is still within the valid 28-day period.\r\n\r\n(b) Amend the quantity of the prescription to meet all legal requirements and then dispense the prescription \u2013 Incorrect, as the quantity is already written in both words and figures, so no amendment is needed.\r\n\r\n(c) Provide an emergency supply and request a new prescription from the consultant \u2013 Incorrect, as gabapentin cannot be supplied in an emergency.\r\n\r\n(e) The prescription meets all legal requirements therefore dispense the prescription \u2013 Incorrect, as it is not on the required standardised form.\r\n\r\nAs gabapentin is a Schedule 3 controlled drug, it must be prescribed on a standardised form for legal compliance. \r\nThe pharmacist cannot dispense this prescription as it lacks the required form and cannot be supplied in an emergency. \r\nThe patient should be informed and referred back to their prescriber for a valid prescription to ensure safe and lawful dispensing.\r\n\r\nWatch MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "**Theme: Controlled drug prescribing**\r\n**Instruction: For each of the scenarios below, select the most appropriate answer option from the list above. Each option may be used once, more than once, or not at all.**",
    "why": "F. Schedules 2-5 for any medical condition within their competence, except diamorphine, cocaine, and dipipanone for the treatment of addiction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPharmacist independent prescribers are permitted to prescribe controlled drugs in Schedules 2-5 for any medical condition within their competence, except for diamorphine, cocaine, and dipipanone if the purpose is treating addiction. However, these drugs can be prescribed for other conditions, such as chronic pain management or palliative care, provided that the prescriber is competent to manage the patient\u2019s condition and the treatment falls within their scope of practice.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Cannot prescribe controlled drugs in Schedules 2-5\r\nIncorrect. Pharmacist independent prescribers have broader prescribing rights and can prescribe controlled drugs from Schedules 2-5, with certain restrictions.\r\n\r\nB. Can only prescribe oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, and dihydrocodeine\r\nIncorrect. This restriction applies to podiatrist independent prescribers. Pharmacists have a broader range of controlled drugs they can prescribe.\r\n\r\nC. Can only prescribe oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, dihydrocodeine, oxycodone, IV and oral morphine, and fentanyl patches\r\nIncorrect. Pharmacist prescribers are not limited to these specific drugs and can prescribe across Schedules 2-5 for appropriate conditions within their competence.\r\n\r\nD. Can prescribe Schedules 2-5 controlled drugs and does not need a standardised form for private prescriptions for Schedules 2 and 3\r\nIncorrect. A standardised form is required for private prescriptions for Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs.\r\n\r\nE. Can prescribe any controlled drug listed in Schedules 2-5 for the treatment of addiction\r\nIncorrect. Pharmacists are restricted from prescribing diamorphine, cocaine, and dipipanone for addiction treatment, though these may be prescribed for other medical indications.\r\n\r\nG. Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs only\r\nIncorrect. Pharmacist independent prescribers can prescribe Schedules 2-5 within their professional scope and competence.\r\n\r\nH. Schedule 4 and 5 controlled medicines only\r\nIncorrect. This limitation does not apply to pharmacist independent prescribers, who may prescribe Schedules 2-5 with specified restrictions.\r\n\r\nUnder MEP guidelines, pharmacist independent prescribers have prescribing authority for controlled drugs in Schedules 2-5, excluding diamorphine, cocaine, and dipipanone when used for treating addiction. This authority is intended to provide appropriate access to controlled medications for the management of medical conditions such as chronic pain, while safeguarding against inappropriate prescribing for addiction. Pharmacists are expected to prescribe within their competence, ensuring patient safety and adherence to regulatory standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch OTC lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Regulation 225 of the Human Medicines Regulations enables emergency supplies at the request of a patient",
    "why": "E) Prescription must be obtained within 72 hours\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor an emergency supply at the request of a patient, there is no legal requirement that a prescription be obtained within 72 hours. This criterion applies only when an emergency supply is requested by a prescriber, not by the patient. At a patient\u2019s request, the pharmacist may provide an emergency supply if specific conditions are met, but there is no time limit for obtaining a subsequent prescription.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Maximum 5 days supply for Schedule 4 Controlled drugs \u2013 This is a correct requirement. For Schedule 4 Part I controlled drugs (such as Clobazam), an emergency supply at a patient\u2019s request can only cover a maximum of 5 days. This regulation helps control the availability of these drugs while addressing immediate patient needs in a limited capacity.\r\n\r\nB) Pharmacist is satisfied there is an immediate need \u2013 This criterion is essential for emergency supplies. The pharmacist must be convinced that the patient has an urgent requirement for the medication, making an immediate supply necessary to maintain their health or prevent adverse effects from an interrupted treatment.\r\n\r\nC) Pharmacist to interview the patient \u2013 A direct interview with the patient is required for an emergency supply at the patient\u2019s request. This interaction allows the pharmacist to assess the patient\u2019s condition, determine the necessity of the medication, and ensure safe dispensing based on the patient\u2019s history.\r\n\r\nD) POM requested must have been used as previous treatment \u2013 The medication requested for an emergency supply must be one that the patient has previously been prescribed, ensuring that the patient is familiar with the medication and its effects. This requirement also supports continuity in treatment, reducing the risk of adverse reactions to unfamiliar medications.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation 225 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 governs emergency supplies of prescription-only medicines (POMs) at a patient\u2019s request, enabling pharmacists to provide urgent medication under specific conditions. The key criteria for patient-requested emergency supplies include that the pharmacist is satisfied there is an immediate need, the medicine has been previously prescribed for the patient, and an interview is conducted to assess the situation. For Schedule 4 Part I controlled drugs, only a maximum of 5 days\u2019 supply can be issued, ensuring adherence to controlled substance regulations.\r\n\r\nUnlike emergency supplies requested by a prescriber, there is no statutory requirement for obtaining a prescription within a certain time frame when an emergency supply is at the patient\u2019s request. These guidelines are designed to balance access to essential medications with regulatory control, supporting pharmacists in making safe, compliant decisions when addressing urgent patient needs.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "title": "**Which of the following is a Schedule 2 Controlled medicine?**",
    "text": "There are different classifications of Controlled drugs",
    "why": "(d) Secobarbital\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nSecobarbital is classified as a Schedule 2 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations. While most barbiturates fall under Schedule 3, secobarbital is an exception and is classified as Schedule 2 due to its potential for misuse and dependence. Schedule 2 drugs generally have higher restrictions, including requirements for secure storage, detailed record-keeping, and controlled dispensing protocols.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) Gabapentin: Gabapentin is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug. It is not classified as Schedule 2 because its risk profile is generally lower than drugs in Schedule 2.\r\n\r\n(b) Midazolam: Midazolam is classified as Schedule 3, commonly used for short-term sedation, and does not carry the same strict regulations as Schedule 2 drugs.\r\n\r\n(c) Sativex: Sativex, a cannabis-based product, is a Schedule 4 Part 1 Controlled Drug, allowing for its use under specific medical conditions without the tight restrictions of Schedule 2 drugs.\r\n\r\n(e) Temazepam: Temazepam is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug used primarily for its sedative properties, requiring some controls but not as stringent as those for Schedule 2.\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guide and NICE guidelines outline the classification of controlled drugs, which helps pharmacists comply with regulations regarding storage, dispensing, and record-keeping. Schedule 2 drugs, like secobarbital, have stricter controls due to their high potential for misuse, necessitating secured storage in a controlled drugs cabinet and logging each transaction in the controlled drugs register. Understanding the classification and associated legal obligations for each schedule ensures safe and compliant handling of controlled substances in pharmacy practice.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(c) Faxed controlled drug requisition forms are legally acceptable\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe statement is incorrect because faxed or photocopied requisition forms for controlled drugs are not legally acceptable. For the requisition to be valid, it must be a physical, original document. Accepting faxed or copied requisitions could compromise security and accountability measures surrounding controlled drug distribution.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) A Home Office license is needed to be in possession of Schedule 1 controlled medicines: This is correct. Possession of Schedule 1 drugs is generally prohibited unless the person has a Home Office license, as these drugs have no recognised therapeutic use in the UK.\r\n\r\n(b) A standardised form is not needed if a hospital pharmacy receives a requisition from a ward within the same legal entity: This is also correct. Hospital pharmacies can receive controlled drug requisitions from wards within the same entity without a standardised form.\r\n\r\n(d) In an emergency, a dentist can be supplied with a Schedule 2 or 3 controlled drug if the requisition will be supplied within 24 hours: This is correct. In an emergency, dentists or doctors can obtain Schedule 2 or 3 drugs if they provide a requisition within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n(e) Pharmacists are not able to requisition Schedule 1 controlled medicines: This is correct. Schedule 1 drugs require a Home Office license for possession, and pharmacists are not authorised to requisition these drugs without one.\r\n\r\nAccording to Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, requisition forms for Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs must generally be submitted on a standardised, signed form and must be the original document rather than a faxed or photocopied version. For Schedule 1 drugs, Home Office licensing is necessary, as these drugs have no therapeutic use in the UK. Additionally, emergency provisions allow doctors and dentists to obtain Schedule 2 or 3 controlled drugs immediately, provided they submit a requisition within 24 hours. Pharmacists play a critical role in ensuring that all requisition requirements for controlled drugs are strictly met.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "D) Registers must be retained for 2 years after the first entry\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n\r\nAccording to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, the legal requirement is to retain controlled drugs registers for 2 years after the last entry made, not the first. This ensures that the records are available for inspection or audit and that any controlled drugs transactions are fully traceable.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA) Copies of registers must be shown to an inspector upon request: This is correct. Pharmacists must make their controlled drugs registers available to authorised persons (such as inspectors) for inspection as per the regulations. This ensures accountability and compliance with the law.\r\n\r\nB) Records can be kept in their original form: This is correct. Controlled drugs registers can be kept either in paper form or electronically, as long as they are accurate and easily accessible.\r\n\r\nC) Registers must be kept at the premises: This is correct. Controlled drugs registers must be kept on-site at the pharmacy where the controlled drugs are stored. This is necessary for regular access and auditing.\r\n\r\nE) Registers must be retained for 2 years after the last entry: This is correct. The legal retention period is two years from the last entry in the register, allowing sufficient time for auditing and inspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPharmacies are required to maintain a register of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs (CDs), documenting their receipt, supply, and any other movement. This register must be kept at the pharmacy premises and available for inspection by authorities. The records must be retained for two years from the last entry, which ensures the traceability and accountability of controlled drug transactions. Electronic and paper records are both acceptable, provided they are accurate and accessible. This is in line with the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (as amended), which set out the requirements for the handling of controlled substances to ensure their proper use and prevent misuse.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Tallman lettering is used to reduce the risk of LASA's.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n\r\nA) AlloPURinol v ATENolol\r\nB) AMlodipine v AMtriptyline\r\nC) CARbimazole v CARbamazepine\r\nD) PRopranolol v PREDnisolone\r\nE) QUEtiapine v QUInine",
    "why": "A) AlloPURinol v ATENolol\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nTallman lettering is a method used in healthcare to minimise the risk of errors with Look-Alike Sound-Alike (LASA) medications. This technique capitalises certain letters in each drug name to visually distinguish one medication from another, particularly those with similar names or phonetics. This is especially useful in pharmacy settings to reduce medication errors during dispensing.\r\n\r\nIn Option A (AlloPURinol v ATENolol), the capitalised segments in each drug name (PUR and TEN) effectively highlight the differences between these two medications. This visual contrast helps distinguish Allopurinol (used to treat gout) from Atenolol (a beta-blocker for hypertension), supporting safe medication management.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\nB) AMlodipine v AMtriptyline\r\n\r\nBoth names start with \"AM\" in uppercase, which could lead to confusion rather than clarity. Tallman lettering is most effective when the capitalised letters occur in unique parts of each drug name.\r\nC) CARbimazole v CARbamazepine\r\n\r\nHere, \"CAR\" is capitalised in both names, which does not help to distinguish these two medications effectively. As both names start with the same sequence, additional or differently placed capitalisation would be more appropriate.\r\nD) PRopranolol v PREDnisolone\r\n\r\nWhile there is some capitalisation, it is not positioned optimally. These names may still be difficult to differentiate quickly, as the beginning letters \"PR\" are similar.\r\nE) QUEtiapine v QUInine\r\n\r\nThough this option uses some capitalisation, the similarity of the letters \u201cQUE\u201d and \u201cQUI\u201d may still pose a risk. In contrast, Option A provides clearer separation in the middle of each name, making it easier to distinguish.\r\n\r\nTallman lettering is a safety measure in the pharmacy setting that capitalises parts of Look-Alike Sound-Alike (LASA) medication names to reduce the risk of dispensing errors. For example, AlloPURinol v ATENolol effectively uses Tallman lettering by capitalising the segments PUR and TEN, which are distinct parts of each name, enhancing the visual distinction. This strategy is especially beneficial in environments where quick differentiation is necessary to ensure patient safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Physiotherapist independent prescribers can prescribe certain Controlled medicines",
    "why": "E) Oxycodone injection\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPhysiotherapists who are independent prescribers are authorised to prescribe certain controlled medicines. However, there are restrictions on injectable forms of certain drugs. Oxycodone, for example, can only be prescribed by independent prescribers for oral formulations, not for injectable forms. Therefore, physiotherapists are unable to prescribe injectable oxycodone.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Dihydrocodeine tablets \u2013 Physiotherapists can prescribe this oral form of dihydrocodeine, a controlled medicine used for pain relief.\r\n\r\nB) Fentanyl patches \u2013 Fentanyl patches are a strong opioid prescribed for pain management, and physiotherapists can prescribe them in their patch form.\r\n\r\nC) Lorazepam tablets \u2013 Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, can be prescribed by physiotherapists for managing anxiety or sleep disorders.\r\n\r\nD) Morphine injection \u2013 Physiotherapists can prescribe injectable morphine for pain management, making it an acceptable option for prescription.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics and Practice (MEP) guidelines specify that while physiotherapists can prescribe certain controlled drugs, they are restricted from prescribing injectable versions of certain medications, such as oxycodone.

    "why": "B. Can only prescribe oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, and di-hydrocodeine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nPodiatrist independent prescribers are limited in their controlled drug prescribing authority. They are restricted to prescribing oral formulations of diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, and di-hydrocodeine for conditions related to their scope of practice, such as musculoskeletal pain or anxiety associated with podiatric treatment. Other controlled drugs, particularly those beyond Schedule 4, are outside their permitted prescribing range, necessitating a referral to an appropriately qualified prescriber for further treatment.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Cannot prescribe controlled drugs in Schedules 2-5\r\nIncorrect. Podiatrist independent prescribers do have some authority, limited to specific Schedule 4 and 5 controlled drugs, within their scope of practice.\r\n\r\nC. Can only prescribe oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, di-hydrocodeine, oxycodone, IV and oral morphine, and fentanyl patches\r\nIncorrect. This authority applies to advanced practitioners in fields like palliative care; podiatrists are limited to fewer controlled drugs and cannot prescribe stronger opioids like oxycodone or morphine.\r\n\r\nD. Can prescribe Schedule 2-5 controlled drugs and does not need a standardised form for private prescriptions for Schedules 2 and 3\r\nIncorrect. Podiatrist prescribers cannot prescribe Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 drugs and must adhere to a limited selection of Schedule 4 and 5 drugs.\r\n\r\nE. Can prescribe any controlled drug listed in Schedules 2-5 for the treatment of addiction\r\nIncorrect. Only practitioners licensed to treat addiction, such as specific doctors, may prescribe for addiction treatment. Podiatrists are not permitted to prescribe controlled drugs for addiction treatment.\r\n\r\nF. Schedules 2-5 for any medical condition within their competence, except diamorphine, cocaine, and dipipanone for addiction treatment\r\nIncorrect. Podiatrists have a restricted scope, limited to specific Schedule 4 drugs; they cannot prescribe controlled drugs more broadly.\r\n\r\nG. Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs only\r\nIncorrect. Podiatrists cannot prescribe Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 drugs, as their authority extends only to specific drugs within Schedules 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nH. Schedule 4 and 5 controlled medicines only\r\nPartially correct but incomplete. While podiatrists can prescribe Schedule 4 and 5 controlled drugs, only a limited range is authorised within their professional scope.\r\n\r\nAccording to the MEP, prescribing authority for controlled drugs depends on the practitioner's qualifications and the specific drug schedule. Podiatrist independent prescribers are restricted to a small selection of controlled drugs, specifically oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, and di-hydrocodeine, for use within their scope of practice. These restrictions are designed to ensure that controlled drug use aligns with the practitioner's expertise while maintaining patient safety.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch OTC lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Schools can obtain adrenaline auto injections and/or salbutamol on signed order for emergency treatment for pupils previously prescribed these medicines",
    "why": "D) Pharmacist name and address supplying the medicine\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe name and address of the pharmacist supplying the medicine are not required as part of the record for a signed order. The signed order record focuses on details necessary to trace the supplied medication, confirm its use, and document relevant patient and supply information, rather than the specifics of the pharmacist's identity or business address.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Date of POM supplied \u2013 This is a required record detail, as it documents when the prescription-only medicine (POM) was supplied. Recording the supply date is essential for tracking and verifying the timing of medication provision for school emergencies.\r\n\r\nB) Name and address of business or profession to whom medicine is supplied to \u2013 This is a required detail, ensuring that the medicine is being supplied to a legitimate recipient, such as a school. This information allows traceability and accountability, confirming the medicine\u2019s intended destination.\r\n\r\nC) Name and quantity of medicine supplied \u2013 Recording the name and quantity of the medicine supplied is necessary for clarity and verification of the type and amount of medication provided, which is critical for accurate inventory and regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\nE) Purpose of signed order \u2013 The purpose of the signed order must be documented, confirming that the medication is intended for emergency use for pupils previously prescribed the treatment. This detail helps ensure that the medication is used correctly and supports its intended purpose in an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics and Practice (MEP) guidelines outline specific requirements for signed orders to ensure safe and accountable medication provision in schools. When schools obtain emergency medicines, such as adrenaline auto-injectors or salbutamol inhalers, a record must include the date of supply, the name and address of the receiving institution, the name and quantity of medicine supplied, and the intended purpose of the medication. These requirements allow for clear tracking and traceability, confirming that these medicines are held securely and used appropriately in school emergencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, the name and address of the supplying pharmacist are not part of the legal requirements. The MEP guidelines prioritise details directly related to patient safety and regulatory compliance, focusing on the purpose, recipient, and medication specifics to ensure that schools can access emergency treatments safely and responsibly without unnecessary administrative burdens.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "It is a Saturday morning, a 60 year old patient presents to the pharmacy requesting an emergency supply of Clobazam 10mg tablets. He informs he is away from home and he needs medication to prevent nocturnal seizures.",
    "why": "D) Supply 5 days worth of treatment as an emergency supply\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe most appropriate action is to supply 5 days' worth of Clobazam 10mg tablets as an emergency supply. Clobazam, a Schedule 4 Part I controlled drug, is legally allowed to be supplied in an emergency, but only for a maximum of 5 days. This emergency supply ensures the patient can manage his nocturnal seizures temporarily until he can obtain a full prescription.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Advise him it is illegal for you to give controlled medicines as an emergency supply \u2013 This option is incorrect. Although some controlled drugs are restricted in emergency supply situations, Schedule 4 Part I drugs, including Clobazam, can be supplied legally for up to 5 days in an emergency. Advising the patient otherwise would deprive him of needed medication and could increase the risk of seizures.\r\n\r\nB) Refer him to accident and emergency \u2013 This option may not be appropriate in this context. While A&E could provide emergency care, the patient requires ongoing seizure management, which a short-term emergency supply of Clobazam can address without needing to escalate to A&E. Providing the emergency supply within legal limits is more suitable and supports the patient\u2019s need promptly.\r\n\r\nC) Refer him to his general practitioner \u2013 Referring him to his GP may not be feasible on a Saturday, as most GP practices are closed on weekends. Given that an emergency supply of Clobazam is legally allowed, this option is unnecessary and may delay the patient from receiving essential medication.\r\n\r\nE) Supply 28 days worth of treatment \u2013 This option is not appropriate, as it exceeds the legal limit for supplying Schedule 4 Part I drugs as an emergency supply. The law permits a maximum of 5 days' supply, making this option non-compliant and potentially unsafe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics and Practice (MEP) guidelines provide clear instructions on emergency supplies of controlled drugs. Pharmacists may supply certain controlled medicines, such as Schedule 4 Part I drugs like Clobazam, for a maximum of 5 days in an emergency, provided there is an immediate need, such as preventing seizures. This regulation supports continuity of care while upholding legal restrictions to prevent misuse. Referring patients to A&E or GP services should be reserved for situations where an emergency supply is not legally permissible or if the patient\u2019s condition is unstable and requires immediate medical intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(C) Dispense amoxicillin and advise the patient to return to their dentist for a new prescription.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nDentists using an FP10D (NHS dental prescription form) are restricted to prescribing medications listed in the Dental Practitioners\u2019 Formulary (DPF). In this case, amoxicillin is appropriate and listed in the DPF for treating dental infections like abscesses. However, co-codamol is not listed in the DPF, and therefore cannot be dispensed under an NHS dental prescription. The correct action is to dispense the amoxicillin and advise the patient to return to their dentist for an alternative pain management prescription that complies with the DPF.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Dispense both medications without any further action:\r\nIncorrect. Since co-codamol is not in the DPF, it should not be dispensed on an NHS prescription from a dentist. This would be against NHS prescription guidelines.\r\n\r\n(B) Dispense amoxicillin only:\r\nPartially correct, but without advising the patient to consult the dentist for alternative pain management, this action would leave the patient without necessary guidance on addressing her pain appropriately.\r\n\r\n(D) Dispense an alternative medication that is listed in the DPF:\r\nIncorrect. Substituting medications without authorization from the prescriber is not permitted. The patient should consult the dentist for a new prescription instead.\r\n\r\n(E) Refuse to dispense both medications:\r\nIncorrect. Amoxicillin is listed in the DPF, and withholding it would delay necessary treatment for the abscess.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DPF limits the medications that NHS dentists can prescribe. For prescriptions issued on FP10D forms, only drugs listed in the DPF should be dispensed. In this scenario, dispensing amoxicillin complies with the guidelines, while co-codamol does not. Patients requiring non-DPF medications for pain relief should be advised to return to their dentist for an alternative DPF-compatible prescription or consider obtaining a private prescription if appropriate. This approach aligns with MEP guidance on the handling of restricted NHS dental prescriptions.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson Chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Community pharmacies must adhere to these standards through mandatory requirements such as clinical audits and other governance-related activities.\r\n\r\nA. Clinical audit (Correct):\r\n\r\nPharmacy contractors must conduct at least two clinical audits annually:\r\n\r\nOne nationally determined clinical audit, such as one defined by NHS England.\r\nOne locally chosen clinical audit, tailored to meet specific service needs.\r\nThese audits evaluate clinical practices and outcomes, identifying areas for improvement to enhance patient care.\r\n\r\nB.

Unpublished patient survey (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nPharmacies must conduct an annual patient satisfaction survey, but its results must be published, making the phrase \"unpublished patient survey\" inaccurate.\r\n\r\nAs part of clinical governance, pharmacy contractors are required to complete two clinical audits annually\u2014one nationally mandated and one locally determined. These audits serve to review and improve clinical practices, ensuring high-quality patient care and compliance with healthcare standards.\r\n\r\nOther activities such as publishing patient survey results, maintaining up-to-date governance practices, and reaccreditation of services complement clinical governance but are not universally mandated annually. By adhering to these requirements, pharmacies uphold their commitment to safe, effective, and patient-centred care.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "E) 28 x Phenobarbital 50mg tablets for epilepsy\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis answer is least suitable for an emergency supply because Phenobarbital is classified as a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. While it is commonly used to treat epilepsy, the maximum quantity that can be supplied for emergency treatment is 5 days' supply, not 28 days. This is due to its controlled status, which limits the quantity available for emergency supply to prevent misuse and to ensure careful monitoring of its use.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) 4 x Zopiclone 7.5mg \u2013 This is a suitable emergency supply in the context of a short-term need for insomnia treatment. Zopiclone is not a controlled drug and can be given in limited quantities for emergency situations, although care should be taken to assess for misuse risks.\r\n\r\nB) 7 x Medroxyprogesterone 5mg tablets \u2013 This is an appropriate emergency supply. Medroxyprogesterone is a hormone used in various therapeutic contexts, and a 7-day supply is reasonable for ensuring continuity of treatment.\r\n\r\nC) 14 x Metformin 500mg tablets \u2013 This is a suitable supply for patients with diabetes. A 14-day supply of Metformin ensures the patient can continue managing their blood sugar levels without interruption while awaiting a full prescription.\r\n\r\nD) 21 x Amlodipine 10mg tablets \u2013 This is a suitable emergency supply. Amlodipine is used for managing hypertension and angina. A 21-day supply is appropriate to maintain ongoing treatment for patients with chronic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Regulation 225 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, patients can request emergency supplies of their prescribed medication when they have run out and are unable to get a new prescription in time. However, controlled drugs, such as Phenobarbital (a Schedule 3 controlled drug), are subject to stricter regulations. The maximum quantity that can be supplied for emergency treatment is 5 days, reflecting the need for careful monitoring and regulation of controlled substances.\r\n\r\nMedications such as Zopiclone, Medroxyprogesterone, Metformin, and Amlodipine, which are not subject to such strict controls, can be supplied in more appropriate quantities for emergency purposes, depending on the clinical need. Pharmacists must balance the patient's immediate needs with regulatory requirements to ensure patient safety and compliance with the law.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "You receive a veterinary prescription for a dashound called Rolls. However you realise you cannot dispense the prescription.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn extract has been provided for this question\u00a0\r\n![3](https://i.ibb.co/nMrVLr4/3.png \"600x400\")",
    "why": "(D) The statement of \u201cto be prescribed under the cascade is missing\u201d\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor a veterinary prescription to be legally valid when prescribing a medication not specifically licensed for the animal\u2019s species or condition, it must include the statement \u201cto be prescribed under the cascade.\u201d The cascade system allows veterinarians to prescribe medicines not licensed for certain animal use in specific circumstances, ensuring the treatment aligns with legal requirements for off-license use. The absence of this phrase renders the prescription legally invalid.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) No withdrawal period is stated:\r\nIncorrect. The withdrawal period is only mandatory for food-producing animals, like livestock, to ensure drug residues clear before consumption. Since Rolls is a dashound (non-food-producing animal), this information is not required.\r\n\r\n(B) Owner's date of birth is missing:\r\nIncorrect. Although the owner's name and address are necessary on a veterinary prescription, the date of birth is not a legal requirement.\r\n\r\n(C) The statement \u201cAnimal treatment only\u201d is missing:\r\nIncorrect. While \u201cAnimal treatment only\u201d is essential on the label of the dispensed medication, it is not required directly on the prescription for legal validity.\r\n\r\n(E) Veterinary prescriptions cannot be repeatable:\r\nIncorrect. Veterinary prescriptions can indeed be repeatable if the prescriber specifies repeats. For example, if noted as \u201crepeat 5 times,\u201d this means the prescription allows a total of six dispensations.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary \"cascade\" system is a regulatory framework that allows veterinarians to prescribe medications not specifically licensed for an animal's species or condition when no suitable licensed alternative is available. For any prescription issued under the cascade, it must legally include the statement \u201cto be prescribed under the cascade\u201d to ensure compliance. This phrase is essential when recommending an off-license or alternative treatment, providing clarity on the prescription's validity.\r\n\r\nThe cascade requires a hierarchy of choices: veterinarians should first use licensed medications for the specific species and condition, then consider medications licensed for other species or conditions, and only as a last resort, human medications. All veterinary prescriptions must also include the owner's name and address, the phrase \u201canimal treatment only,\u201d and full details of the medication. Withdrawal periods are only required for food-producing animals, and while the owner's name and address are necessary, their date of birth is not.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch the MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "A. Refuse the sale and advise him he must have a prescription by the veterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is A. Refuse the sale and advise him he must have a prescription by the veterinary surgeon. Under the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013, it is illegal to sell human medicines for use in animals unless the product is prescribed by a veterinary surgeon under the veterinary cascade. This regulation ensures that veterinary medicines are used safely and appropriately, as they are specifically formulated for animal use and may differ in strength, formulation, or dosage compared to human medicines.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nB. Refuse the sale but advise he can purchase in another pharmacy. \u2013 Incorrect. It is not lawful to advise the customer to purchase the medicine elsewhere. The regulation applies to all pharmacies, not just the one in question.\r\nC. Refuse the sale and request he gets a prescription for his GP. \u2013 Incorrect. A GP prescription would not be appropriate for an animal. Only a veterinary surgeon can prescribe medicines for animals.\r\nD. Say you have not got any in stock. \u2013 Incorrect. This option misrepresents the issue. The problem is not about stock availability but the legal requirement for a veterinary prescription for animal use.\r\nE. Sell chloramphenicol eye drops. \u2013 Incorrect. As mentioned, human medicines cannot be sold for use in animals without a prescription from a veterinary surgeon under the veterinary cascade.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013, it is illegal to sell human medicines, such as chloramphenicol eye drops, for use in animals without a veterinary prescription. These regulations ensure animal welfare and safety, as medications need to be specifically prescribed by a veterinary surgeon, considering the different needs of animals versus humans. Therefore, the correct course of action is to refuse the sale and advise the customer to obtain a prescription from a veterinary surgeon.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "Correct Answer:\r\n\r\nD) Use the title \u2018Dr\u2019 before the signature to verify the authenticity of the prescription\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUsing a title such as \u201cDr\u201d before a signature is not a reliable or appropriate method of verifying a prescription. Titles can be easily written by anyone and are not unique identifiers of a prescriber. Verifying authenticity requires checking with the prescriber directly using independent contact details and reviewing the content and format of the prescription thoroughly.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Confirm details with the prescriber using contact details obtained from a source other than the suspicious prescription\r\n\r\nAppropriate \u2013 This is best practice. Always use an independent and trusted source (e.g. NHS website, practice contact details on record) to contact the prescriber when in doubt.\r\n\r\nB) Confirm whether or not a prescription has been issued, the original intention of the prescriber, and whether or not there has been an alteration\r\n\r\nAppropriate \u2013 It is important to confirm the validity and intent of the prescriber if forgery is suspected.\r\n\r\nC) Scrutinise the signature carefully, possibly checking against a known genuine prescription from the same prescriber\r\n\r\nAppropriate \u2013 Comparing the signature with a known example can help spot inconsistencies or signs of forgery.\r\n\r\nE) Use contact details for the prescriber that are obtained from a source other than the suspicious prescription\r\n\r\nAppropriate \u2013 Reinforces the need to avoid using the potentially forged document itself as a source of contact details.\r\n\r\nInvestigating Forged Prescriptions (MEP Guidance):\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics and Practice (MEP) guide:\r\n\r\n- Pharmacists must be vigilant and take reasonable steps to verify the authenticity of prescriptions when there is any suspicion.\r\n\r\n- Use independent contact details to speak directly with the prescriber.\r\n\r\n- Do not rely solely on the title, signature, or contact details printed on the prescription if forgery is suspected.\r\n\r\n- It is acceptable to refuse to dispense if there is reasonable doubt about authenticity and to report suspicious activity to appropriate authorities (e.g. NHS counter fraud or local controlled drug liaison officer, if relevant).\r\n\r\n- Controlled drugs carry additional forgery risks and should be scrutinised even more closely.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please watch MEP lesson Chapter 2 (Professional And Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "title": "**Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding pseudoephedrine?**",
    "text": "A 43-year-old female patient presenting in your pharmacy with nasal congestion and would like to purchase some decongestants",
    "why": "C. She can purchase a maximum legal quantity of 720mg of pseudoephedrine.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to UK regulations, pseudoephedrine-containing products can only be sold in limited quantities. The maximum legal quantity that can be sold without a prescription is 720 mg. This limit applies to any combination of products containing pseudoephedrine or ephedrine in a single transaction.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Pseudoephedrine-containing medicines can only be sold either by the Pharmacist or under supervision of the responsible pharmacist:\r\nThis is incorrect. While pseudoephedrine is a regulated substance and must be sold under supervision, it is not specifically restricted to only being sold by the pharmacist or under their direct supervision. As long as the responsible pharmacist is available, others can assist with the sale, but it must be done in accordance with legal requirements, such as limiting the quantity sold.\r\n\r\nB. She can purchase a maximum legal quantity of 180mg of pseudoephedrine:\r\nThis is incorrect. The maximum legal quantity is 720 mg, not 180 mg. The 180 mg limit applies to ephedrine, not pseudoephedrine.\r\n\r\nD. She can purchase one packet of pseudoephedrine for herself and the other packet for her daughter:\r\nThis is incorrect. The legal limit of 720 mg applies to the total amount of pseudoephedrine being sold in a single transaction. A customer cannot buy multiple packets that, together, exceed the 720 mg limit.\r\n\r\nE. She can purchase two separate products which containing pseudoephedrine and the other phenylephrine:\r\nThis is incorrect. While phenylephrine is a common decongestant, it does not count toward the limit on pseudoephedrine. However, the key point here is that the law limits the total amount of pseudoephedrine in a single transaction, not phenylephrine. If the total amount of pseudoephedrine from the products exceeds 720 mg, it would be illegal.\r\n\r\nPseudoephedrine is a regulated substance due to its potential for misuse in the production of illicit drugs. As per UK regulations, the maximum legal quantity of pseudoephedrine that can be sold without a prescription is 720 mg. Any sales exceeding this limit must be prescribed by a doctor. Additionally, sales of pseudoephedrine-containing products must be controlled to ensure the amount sold in any given transaction does not exceed legal thresholds. Pharmacists are responsible for ensuring that sales comply with these regulations to prevent misuse while ensuring that legitimate patients have access to the medication they need for conditions like nasal congestion.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "B. Explain that you can make a supply which is limited to only 5 days\u2019 worth of treatment.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, an emergency supply of a controlled drug is permitted in specific circumstances. For Schedule 3 controlled drugs, such as phenobarbital (when prescribed for epilepsy), the pharmacist can supply no more than 5 days\u2019 worth of treatment.\r\n\r\nThis supply is permissible because:\r\n\r\nPhenobarbital is the only Schedule 3 CD permitted for emergency supply under these conditions, provided the pharmacist is satisfied of its necessity.\r\nThe patient must provide evidence of prior use (e.g., a labelled box or verbal confirmation).\r\nThe pharmacist must make a record of the supply, including the patient\u2019s GP details, the medicine details, and the rationale for the emergency supply.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. Explain that you can make a supply if she furnishes a prescription within 72 hours.\r\nThis is incorrect because phenobarbital does not require the patient to furnish a prescription within 72 hours for an emergency supply. This requirement applies to some other CDs under specific conditions.\r\n\r\nC. Explain that you cannot make a supply as controlled drugs fall outside of emergency supply rules.\r\nThis is incorrect because phenobarbital, when used for epilepsy, is specifically allowed under emergency supply rules despite being a Schedule 3 controlled drug.\r\n\r\nD. Supply the drug for a 30-day duration and make a record detailing this alongside her doctor\u2019s details.\r\nThis is incorrect because only a 5-day supply is permitted for Schedule 3 controlled drugs under emergency supply rules. A 30-day supply applies only to certain prescription-only medicines, not controlled drugs.\r\n\r\nE. Supply the drug and make a record detailing her general practitioner\u2019s name and registration number.\r\nThis is incorrect because while a record must be made, the supply is limited to 5 days for phenobarbital, not an unrestricted amount. Additionally, there is no requirement to record the GP's registration number.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency supply regulations allow pharmacists to provide a maximum of 5 days' worth of Schedule 3 controlled drugs, such as phenobarbital, for epilepsy. This exception ensures that patients can access essential medications for a chronic condition when unexpected circumstances arise. Pharmacists must exercise professional judgment, ensure the supply is appropriate, and document all necessary details, including the patient\u2019s GP information and rationale for the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Amend the prescription indelibly so the prescription is compliant with the regulations.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (as amended), a pharmacist is permitted to make technical amendments to a prescription for Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs (e.g., morphine sulfate) in certain situations. The pharmacist can amend the prescription indelibly if:\r\n\r\nEither the quantity in words or the quantity in figures is missing (but not both).\r\nThere are minor typographical errors.\r\nIn this scenario, the prescription does not include the quantity written in words, but it does include the quantity in figures (120 capsules). This means the pharmacist can correct the prescription to comply with the regulations without requiring a new prescription.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Amend the prescription indelibly so the prescription is compliant with the regulations\r\n\r\nPharmacists have the authority to amend a Schedule 2 or 3 controlled drug prescription for minor technical details, such as adding the quantity in words. This ensures the prescription complies with legal requirements and allows the pharmacist to supply the medication.\r\n\r\nB. Explain the quantity is not written in words and figures therefore you cannot dispense the prescription\r\n\r\nIf only one of these is missing, the pharmacist can amend the prescription themselves. Refusing to dispense in this case is unnecessary and would cause undue delay for the patient.\r\n\r\nC. Provide 5 days\u2019 worth of medication as an emergency supply\r\n\r\nEmergency supply provisions do not apply to Schedule 2 controlled drugs (except phenobarbital for epilepsy). Morphine sulfate cannot be supplied as an emergency without a valid prescription.\r\n\r\nD. Refer to NHS 111 for a new prescription\r\n\r\nNHS 111 does not issue prescriptions directly; they may arrange out-of-hours GP services. However, this step is unnecessary because the pharmacist can legally amend the prescription.\r\n\r\nE. Refer to the general practitioner for a new prescription\r\n\r\nThis would be an unnecessary delay since the pharmacist is authorised to make technical amendments to the prescription under the law.\r\n\r\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (as amended):\r\n\r\nA pharmacist can correct technical details, such as the quantity in words or minor errors, on a Schedule 2 or 3 controlled drug prescription, provided it is indelibly amended.\r\nEmergency supply provisions do not apply to Schedule 2 controlled drugs (except phenobarbital for epilepsy).\r\nPrescriptions for controlled drugs must comply with all legal requirements to be valid, but pharmacists can take action to ensure compliance without involving the prescriber unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson Chapter 3 (Underpinning Knowledge : legislation and professional Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nC. Chlordiazepoxide\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nChlordiazepoxide is classified as a Schedule 4 Part I controlled drug (CD4(1)) under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.\r\nWhile technically, controlled drugs in Schedule 2, 3, and 4 Part I may be prescribed on an instalment basis, chlordiazepoxide is not suitable for instalment dispensing in clinical practice.\r\nChlordiazepoxide is prescribed for short-course alcohol withdrawal (typically 7\u201310 days) and does not require phased supervised dispensing like methadone or buprenorphine regimens do.\r\nInstalments are mainly used for long-term substance withdrawal programmes to promote compliance and reduce misuse, which does not apply to chlordiazepoxide's short-term use.\r\n\r\nThus, even though chlordiazepoxide is legally a controlled drug, it is not appropriate for instalment prescribing in practice.\r\n\r\nExplanation of other options:\r\n\r\nA. Buprenorphine:\r\n\r\nA Schedule 3 controlled drug widely used in opioid substitution therapy. Instalment prescribing is appropriate and commonly used to promote adherence and prevent diversion or misuse.\r\n\r\nB. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination:\r\n\r\nA Schedule 3 controlled drug used for opioid dependence treatment. Also suitable for instalment prescribing under supervised withdrawal frameworks.\r\n\r\nD. Diazepam:\r\n\r\nA Schedule 4 Part I controlled drug. Diazepam can be prescribed on an instalment basis during supervised withdrawal regimens for benzodiazepine dependence or drug detoxification.\r\n\r\nE. Methadone:\r\n\r\nA Schedule 2 controlled drug and the mainstay of opioid substitution therapy. Instalment dispensing is standard practice to maintain therapeutic levels, improve compliance, and minimise overdose risk.\r\n\r\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and BNF guidance, instalment prescribing is allowed for controlled drugs in Schedule 2, 3, and 4 Part I, when clinically appropriate.\r\nMedicines like methadone, buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, and diazepam are commonly dispensed via instalments to support long-term withdrawal management.\r\nAlthough chlordiazepoxide is a Schedule 4 Part I controlled drug, it is not suitable for instalment prescribing because alcohol withdrawal regimens are short-term treatments that do not require phased supervised dispensing.\r\n\r\nPharmacists must ensure instalment prescriptions:\r\n\r\n- Specify the amount per instalment,\r\n\r\n- State the interval between instalments,\r\n\r\n- Use correct legally required wording (e.g., \"Dispense X amount on [specific dates]\").\r\n\r\n- Strict adherence to these requirements supports safe and effective management of withdrawal while remaining fully compliant with legal standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(a) Consult the prescriber if two or more consecutive days of a prescription have been missed.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe Home Office has established specific, approved wording for instalment prescriptions to provide pharmacists with flexibility when supplying controlled drugs like methadone or buprenorphine. This wording is important for ensuring continuity in patient treatment while also maintaining necessary oversight. One of these approved phrases is \u201cConsult the prescriber if three or more consecutive days of a prescription have been missed.\u201d The option \u201cConsult the prescriber if two or more consecutive days of a prescription have been missed\u201d is incorrect because it does not follow the approved guidance, which specifically states three or more consecutive days.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(b) Dispense daily doses in separate containers: This is correct and is an approved phrase to support patient adherence by helping to clarify daily doses.\r\n\r\n(c) If an instalment collection day has been missed, please still dispense the amount due for any remaining day(s) of that instalment: This is correct and is approved wording, allowing for flexibility if a collection is missed.\r\n\r\n(d) Please dispense instalments due on a pharmacy closed days on a prior suitable day: This is correct. This phrase is approved, as it accounts for pharmacy closures and allows for dispensing the instalment early.\r\n\r\n(e) Supervised consumption on collection days: This is correct and approved, indicating that the patient\u2019s dose should be supervised by the pharmacist upon collection.\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guide emphasises that controlled drug prescriptions for instalments, especially for drugs like methadone and buprenorphine used in opioid dependency, must comply with Home Office-approved wording to maintain safety and continuity in patient treatment. Approved phrases help manage missed doses, reinforce daily adherence, and accommodate pharmacy closures. For missed doses, the guidance specifies consulting the prescriber after three missed days, as missing three consecutive doses could indicate a disruption in the patient\u2019s treatment plan that requires intervention. This level of structure ensures that the pharmacist has clear protocols to follow while still maintaining flexibility to support the patient's needs and safety.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

This ensures safe and appropriate supply while allowing the pharmacist to oversee other duties within the pharmacy.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\na) General sale medicines are self-selection of medicines in registered pharmacies.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. General Sale List (GSL) medicines are available for self-selection in registered pharmacies and other approved retail outlets.\r\n\r\nb) General sale medicines can be sold in retail outlets.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. GSL medicines can be sold outside of pharmacies in general retail outlets such as supermarkets, provided the packaging remains intact, and the sale complies with relevant regulations.\r\n\r\nc) General sale medicines can be sold whilst the responsible pharmacist is physically absent for a limited time period whilst remaining responsible.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. GSL medicines can be sold in a registered pharmacy even when the responsible pharmacist is temporarily absent, provided appropriate procedures are in place.\r\n\r\nd) Pharmacy medicines can only be sold by the responsible pharmacist.\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Pharmacy medicines can be sold by trained pharmacy staff under the supervision of the responsible pharmacist. The responsible pharmacist does not need to sell them personally.\r\n\r\ne) Pharmacy medicines must not be accessible for self-selection.\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Pharmacy (P) medicines must not be openly accessible for customers to select themselves. They must be stored in a manner that requires staff intervention to supply them.\r\n\r\nKey Points About the Classification of Medicines\r\n\r\nGeneral Sale List (GSL) Medicines:\r\n\r\nCan be sold in retail outlets, including supermarkets, and are available for self-selection.\r\nMay also be sold in pharmacies even in the temporary absence of the responsible pharmacist.\r\nPharmacy (P) Medicines:\r\n\r\nOnly available in registered pharmacies.\r\nMust be supplied under the supervision of the responsible pharmacist.\r\nCannot be self-selected by customers and must be stored behind the counter or in a restricted area.\r\nPrescription Only Medicines (POMs):\r\n\r\nRequire a valid prescription for supply.\r\nMust be dispensed by a pharmacist or under their direct supervision.\r\n\r\nThe Human Medicines Regulations 2012 define the rules for classifying and selling medicines to ensure safe and appropriate supply. General Sale List (GSL) medicines can be sold in retail outlets or pharmacies and are available for self-selection. Pharmacy (P) medicines, however, require supervision by the responsible pharmacist but can be supplied by trained staff, ensuring compliance without requiring the pharmacist to sell them personally.

Miss A presents the prescription to your chemist on 28/04/17 and tells you that she is \u2018scared of flying\u2019 and needs to take the medication prior to her journey home.\r\n\r\nYou contact Miss A\u2019s surgery in Malta and are assured the prescription is genuine.

    "why": "D. You dispense the script and make a record in the prescription register.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder The Human Medicines Regulations 2012, prescriptions written by a doctor from an EEA (European Economic Area) country, such as Malta, are legally valid in the UK, provided they meet all legal requirements. Diazepam is a Schedule 4 Controlled Drug (CD), and while Schedule 4 CDs are subject to specific regulations, they can be prescribed by an EEA healthcare professional.\r\n\r\nFor private prescriptions, a record of the supply must be made in the private prescription register, and all standard prescription requirements must be met, including:\r\n\r\nPatient details (full name, address, and date of birth).\r\nPrescriber details (name, professional address, qualification, and signature).\r\nMedicine details (name, strength, formulation, dose, and quantity).\r\nDate of issue.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. You cannot dispense the prescription as it is missing some legal parameters.\r\nThis is incorrect as the scenario does not indicate that the prescription is incomplete. It is stated that the prescription is valid and meets all legal requirements.\r\n\r\nB. You cannot dispense the script as Malta is not in the EEA.\r\nMalta is part of the EEA, and prescriptions from EEA healthcare professionals are legally valid in the UK when requirements are met.\r\n\r\nC. You cannot dispense the script as diazepam is a controlled drug.\r\nDiazepam, a Schedule 4 CD, can be dispensed on an EEA prescription. Unlike Schedule 2 and 3 CDs, it does not require additional CD requisition or register documentation for supply in this scenario.\r\n\r\nE. You dispense the script and make a record in the controlled drugs register.\r\nWhile Schedule 4 CDs like diazepam are controlled, they do not require an entry in the controlled drugs register. A record in the private prescription register is sufficient.\r\n\r\nDiazepam is a Schedule 4 Controlled Drug that can be legally dispensed on an EEA prescription if all requirements are met. The pharmacist must record the supply in the private prescription register, ensuring all details are correctly documented. Unlike Schedule 2 or 3 CDs, there is no requirement for entry in the controlled drugs register or for additional witness procedures. Pharmacists must be diligent in verifying the authenticity of the prescription, especially when issued from another country.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "B. A signed order must be signed by the head teacher.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe mechanism for supplying salbutamol inhalers to schools without a prescription is regulated under legislation to ensure these devices are available for emergencies, such as severe asthma attacks in pupils.\r\n\r\nA. Appropriately headed paper is legally required (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nHeaded paper is not a legal requirement, though it is a professional recommendation to help validate the authenticity of the signed order.\r\n\r\nB. A signed order must be signed by the head teacher (Correct):\r\n\r\nLegally, the signed order must be authorised and signed by a person with management responsibility, typically the head teacher or principal of the school. This ensures accountability and proper oversight of the supply process.\r\n\r\nC. A spacer device should be provided with each supply of an inhaler (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nWhile spacer devices can improve the effectiveness of salbutamol delivery, there is no legal requirement to supply a spacer with each inhaler under this mechanism. Schools are responsible for ensuring they have the appropriate devices for use.\r\n\r\nD. The signed order must be retained for 5 years from the date of supply, and a POM register entry made only (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nIt is true that the signed order must be retained for 2 years (not 5 years) and that an entry must be made in the Prescription-Only Medicine (POM) register. This ensures accurate record-keeping and accountability.\r\n\r\nE. Ventolin\u00ae branded inhalers are approved for supply via this mechanism (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nBoth branded (e.g., Ventolin\u00ae) and generic salbutamol inhalers are approved for supply under this mechanism. There is no restriction to specific brands.\r\n\r\nSchools can obtain salbutamol inhalers without a prescription to be used in emergencies for pupils diagnosed with asthma or prescribed an inhaler. The supply must follow specific legal requirements, including:\r\n\r\nA signed order authorised by the head teacher or principal.\r\nRetention of the signed order for 2 years, with an appropriate entry in the POM register.\r\nThe supply can include either generic or branded inhalers, but a spacer device is not mandatory.\r\nWhile appropriately headed paper is not a legal requirement, its use is encouraged to maintain professional standards and ensure clarity. This policy ensures rapid access to lifesaving treatment in emergencies while maintaining robust record-keeping and oversight.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Regulation 218 of the Human Medicines Regulations states the legal requirements for EEA or Switzerland prescriptions",
    "why": "a) Medicines which are not MHRA approved in the UK are acceptable\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThis statement is incorrect because medicines prescribed on EEA/Swiss prescriptions must be approved by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Medicines that are not MHRA-approved cannot be legally dispensed in the UK, even if prescribed by a valid EEA/Swiss prescriber.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\nb) Only Schedule 4 and 5 Controlled Drugs can be prescribed\r\n\r\nThis is correct.

The prescription must include the prescriber's direct contact details (such as email address and telephone number) to allow the dispensing pharmacist to verify the prescription if needed. This ensures authenticity and compliance with the legal framework.\r\n\r\nRegulation 218 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 outlines the requirements for accepting prescriptions issued by EEA or Swiss healthcare professionals. Key points include:\r\n\r\nMedicine Approval: Only medicines approved by the UK\u2019s MHRA can be dispensed.\r\nControlled Drugs: Only Schedule 4 and 5 Controlled Drugs can be prescribed by EEA/Swiss prescribers.\r\nValidity: Prescriptions are generally valid for 6 months, except for Schedule 4 Controlled Drugs, which are valid for 28 days.\r\nPatient and Prescriber Details: Prescriptions must include the patient\u2019s full name and date of birth as well as the prescriber's name, qualifications, contact details, and work address.\r\nPharmacists must carefully assess the validity and compliance of EEA/Swiss prescriptions before dispensing, ensuring patient safety and adherence to UK law.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "A.

According to the MEP, only independent prescribers, with additional qualifications and authority, can prescribe specific controlled drugs. Therefore, the community nurse practitioner must refer the patient to a prescriber with appropriate authority.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nB. Can only prescribe oral diazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, and dihydrocodeine\r\nIncorrect. This limitation applies to specific prescribers like supplementary prescribers or those with limited qualifications, not to community nurse practitioners.\r\n\r\nC.

This applies only to independent prescribers with advanced qualifications and does not include community nurse practitioners.\r\n\r\nG. Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs only\r\nIncorrect. This authority applies to certain advanced prescribers but does not extend to community nurse practitioners, who are not authorised to prescribe any controlled drugs.\r\n\r\nH. Schedule 4 and 5 controlled medicines only\r\nIncorrect. Community nurse practitioners cannot prescribe controlled drugs in any schedule, including Schedules 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the MEP, prescribing authority for controlled drugs varies by practitioner type and requires specific qualifications and regulatory approval. Only independent prescribers and those with advanced qualifications are permitted to prescribe certain controlled drugs within specific guidelines. Community nurse practitioners are not authorised to prescribe any controlled drugs, even in palliative care, as they must refer patients to qualified prescribers for controlled medications.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

They are allowed to prescribe certain Schedule 4 and Schedule 5 controlled drugs, but they cannot prescribe Schedule 2 controlled drugs such as morphine sulphate.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) Diazepam: Podiatrists can prescribe diazepam, a Schedule 4 controlled drug, for appropriate conditions within their prescribing scope.\r\n\r\n(b) Dihydrocodeine: This is a Schedule 5 controlled drug, which podiatrists are authorised to prescribe within their scope of practice.\r\n\r\n(c) Lorazepam: As a Schedule 4 controlled drug, lorazepam can be prescribed by independent prescribers like podiatrists for appropriate cases.\r\n\r\n(e) Temazepam: Temazepam, also a Schedule 3 controlled drug, is within the prescribing authority of podiatrists.\r\n\r\nThe Podiatry Prescribing Regulations allow independent prescribers to prescribe certain controlled medicines, but they cannot prescribe Schedule 2 controlled drugs, which are considered more potent and carry a higher risk of abuse and dependency. Therefore, morphine sulphate is excluded from their prescribing rights due to its classification as a Schedule 2 controlled substance. Podiatrists can prescribe other controlled drugs like dihydrocodeine, diazepam, lorazepam, and temazepam if appropriate for the patient's needs.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "E. The maximum quantity for supply is 30 days for oral retinoids under the pregnancy prevention programme.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity that can be supplied for oral retinoids under the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) is 30 days, not 28 days. This is to ensure that patients do not receive excessive amounts of medication and to promote ongoing monitoring.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. Pharmacists can accept emergency supplies at a request of a PPP specialist prescriber:\r\nThis is correct. Emergency supplies for oral retinoids can be accepted if requested by a PPP specialist prescriber, ensuring the patient has access to the medication in urgent situations while still complying with safety protocols.\r\n\r\nB. Pharmacists should not accept repeat prescriptions for oral retinoids:\r\nThis is correct. Repeat prescriptions are not allowed under the PPP for oral retinoids because each prescription must be reviewed to ensure continued compliance with the programme's strict monitoring requirements.\r\n\r\nC. Prescriptions are valid for 7 days:\r\nThis is correct. Prescriptions for oral retinoids under the PPP are only valid for 7 days from the date the prescription is issued. This short timeframe helps ensure the medication is used in close accordance with safety protocols.\r\n\r\nD. Prescriptions should ideally be dispensed on the date prescription is written:\r\nThis is correct. Ideally, prescriptions for oral retinoids should be dispensed as soon as possible after being written to minimise the time a patient is exposed to the potential risks of pregnancy and to ensure compliance with PPP requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pregnancy Prevention Programme for oral retinoids ensures the safe use of these drugs for females of childbearing potential. The programme has strict requirements to minimise the risk of pregnancy while the patient is using the medication. These requirements include restricting repeat prescriptions, limiting the quantity to 30 days, ensuring prescriptions are dispensed promptly (within 7 days), and requiring ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition and compliance. Emergency supplies are allowed under specific circumstances with an appropriate prescriber request. These guidelines are in place to safeguard both the patient and the unborn child.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

This is outlined under Regulation 225 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. The RP must assess the immediate need for the prescription-only medicine, confirm impracticality of obtaining a prescription without undue delay, verify a prior prescription by a relevant prescriber, and determine the appropriate dose. This responsibility cannot be delegated or carried out in the absence of the RP as per the Responsible Pharmacist Regulations 2008.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the Other Options\r\n\r\na) Date checking\r\n\r\nThis is permissible in the absence of the Responsible Pharmacist as it does not involve patient-facing activities or decisions about the supply of medicines.\r\n\r\nc) Ordering stock from pharmaceutical wholesalers\r\n\r\nThis is an administrative activity that can take place during the absence of the Responsible Pharmacist.

However, the final accuracy check and dispensing to the patient must only occur when the RP is present.\r\n\r\nKey Points About the Role of the Responsible Pharmacist\r\n\r\nEssential Tasks That Require the RP:\r\n\r\nAuthorisation of an emergency supply of medicines (patient or prescriber request).\r\nFinal accuracy check and supply of dispensed medicines.\r\nSupervising the sale or supply of Pharmacy (P) medicines.\r\n\r\nPermissible Activities During RP Absence:\r\n\r\nAdministrative tasks such as ordering stock or managing records.\r\nSale of General Sale List (GSL) medicines.\r\nNon-patient-facing activities like cleaning, maintenance, or date checking.\r\n\r\nAbsence Regulations:\r\n\r\nThe Responsible Pharmacist may be absent for up to two hours during operational hours but must remain contactable and ensure the pharmacy is appropriately staffed to manage safe operations.\r\n\r\nThe Responsible Pharmacist plays a crucial role in overseeing patient safety and medicine supply. While certain non-critical activities (e.g., stock ordering, GSL sales) can proceed during their absence, essential tasks like authorising emergency supplies of medicines require their direct involvement. Adherence to the Responsible Pharmacist Regulations ensures legal compliance and the continuity of safe pharmacy practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 4 (The Responsible Pharmacist)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Midwives can obtain certain Controlled drugs via midwife supply order",
    "why": "E. Pethidine\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is E. Pethidine. According to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, midwives can obtain pethidine, along with diamorphine and morphine, for the purpose of childbirth. These controlled substances are authorised for use in labour and delivery settings to manage pain.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Fentanyl \u2013 Fentanyl is not listed as one of the controlled drugs midwives can obtain via a supply order for childbirth.\r\nB. Lorazepam \u2013 Lorazepam is not authorised for midwife supply orders; it is typically used for anxiety or seizures and is not specific to childbirth.\r\nC. Midazolam \u2013 Similar to lorazepam, midazolam is not approved for midwives to obtain via supply orders for childbirth. It is typically used in sedation or anaesthesia.\r\nD. Oxycodone \u2013 Oxycodone is not available through midwife supply orders for childbirth, as its use in this context is not specified.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidwives are authorised to obtain specific controlled drugs through a midwife supply order, but the drugs must be related to childbirth and pain management. Pethidine, diamorphine, and morphine are the approved medications for midwives to use for pain relief during labour. This restriction helps maintain control over the use of high-risk medications while ensuring they are available for critical situations in childbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Therefore, it must be stored securely.\r\n\r\nC) Morphine sulfate 10mg/1ml ampoules\r\n\r\nCorrect: Morphine sulfate is a Schedule 2 controlled drug, which is subject to the Safe Custody Regulations. Schedule 2 drugs require storage in a locked cabinet or safe.\r\n\r\nD) Oramorph 20mg/5ml oral solution\r\n\r\nCorrect: Oramorph is a Schedule 2 controlled drug.

It must be securely stored in the pharmacy.\r\n\r\nThe Safe Custody Regulations require that specific controlled substances be stored securely to prevent misuse and diversion.\r\n\r\nSchedule 2 controlled drugs, such as morphine and Oramorph, must be stored in a locked cupboard or safe.\r\nCertain Schedule 3 drugs, such as buprenorphine and temazepam, also fall under the Safe Custody Regulations due to their misuse potential and must be securely stored.\r\nMidazolam 5mg/ml ampoules, although a Schedule 3 drug, do not require secure storage under the Safe Custody Regulations unless in injectable form.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Regulation 224 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 enables emergencies supplies on the request of a prescriber",
    "why": "E) The words \"emergency supply\"\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nFor emergency supplies at the request of a prescriber, it is not required to label the product with the words \u201cemergency supply.\u201d This label notation is only mandatory for emergency supplies made at the patient's request. Including it for a prescriber request would be incorrect and unnecessary, as the prescriber has authorised the supply directly, which differs procedurally from a patient-initiated request.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Date of dispensing \u2013 This is a required element on the label for all emergency supplies. Recording the dispensing date is essential for tracking the timeline of medication provision and ensuring accurate record-keeping.\r\n\r\nB) Directions for use \u2013 Directions for use must be included to ensure the patient understands how to take the medication correctly. This guidance is crucial for safe and effective treatment adherence, especially in an emergency context.\r\n\r\nC) Name of medicine \u2013 The medicine\u2019s name is necessary on the label to avoid confusion and ensure the patient receives and recognises the correct medication. Proper labelling with the medicine name is a standard requirement for all dispensed medications.\r\n\r\nD) Name of patient \u2013 Including the patient\u2019s name on the label personalises the medication and prevents accidental administration to someone else. This is particularly important for patient safety and compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Regulation 224 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, emergency supplies of prescription-only medicines (POMs) at the request of a prescriber must adhere to specific labelling standards to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance. When a prescriber requests an emergency supply, the label must include essential details such as the date of dispensing, the medicine name, the patient\u2019s name, and directions for use. These elements promote clear communication and appropriate usage, enabling the patient to manage their treatment safely.\r\n\r\nThe words \u201cemergency supply\u201d are only legally required on labels for emergency supplies requested directly by a patient. Since a prescriber request implies professional oversight and responsibility, this additional notation is not needed. MEP and NICE guidelines reinforce these requirements, supporting pharmacists in delivering accurate, well-labelled medications while maintaining clear distinctions between patient- and prescriber-requested emergency supplies. This framework ensures safe, effective, and regulatory-compliant access to essential medications in urgent situations.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "B) Doctor from Pakistan\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis answer is incorrect because a doctor from Pakistan is not an appropriate prescriber to authorise emergency supplies under Regulation 224 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. The regulation allows emergency supplies to be authorised by prescribers from the UK and EU only. A doctor from outside the EU, such as one from Pakistan, does not meet the criteria for prescribing in the context of emergency supply requests under UK law.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Doctor from France \u2013 A doctor from France is an appropriate prescriber. France is part of the European Union, and under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, prescribers from EU countries are recognised as authorised to make emergency supply requests in the UK.\r\n\r\nC) UK Nurse Independent Prescriber \u2013 A UK Nurse Independent Prescriber is authorised to make emergency supply requests. Nurse independent prescribers in the UK are able to prescribe certain medications, including in emergency situations, as long as they follow the regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nD) UK Optometrist Prescriber \u2013 A UK Optometrist Prescriber is also authorised to make emergency supply requests within their scope of practice. Optometrists in the UK, under specific conditions, can prescribe medications and request emergency supplies for patients in need of treatment.\r\n\r\nE) UK Podiatrist Independent Prescriber \u2013 A UK Podiatrist Independent Prescriber is eligible to authorise emergency supplies. As with other independent prescribers in the UK, podiatrists can prescribe and request emergency supplies of medicines within their professional remit.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation 224 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 permits emergency supplies to be made at the request of a prescriber, but only those from recognised professional bodies within the UK and the EU are eligible. This ensures that prescribers have the necessary qualifications and are subject to appropriate regulatory oversight to ensure patient safety.\r\n\r\nDoctors, nurse independent prescribers, optometrists, and podiatrists from the UK are authorised to make emergency supply requests for prescription-only medicines (POMs), provided they meet the necessary criteria. However, prescribers from outside the EU, such as those from Pakistan, do not have the authority to request emergency supplies under UK law. This regulatory framework helps maintain patient safety while allowing appropriate access to medications in urgent circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Occasionally pharmacists need to administer adrenaline for the treatment of Anaphylaxis",
    "why": "D) Pharmacists require prescriptions for adrenaline prior to administration\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis answer is incorrect because pharmacists do not require a prescription for adrenaline prior to administration in the case of an emergency such as anaphylaxis. Under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, pharmacists can administer adrenaline in an emergency situation without the need for a prior prescription. The key requirement is that adrenaline is administered immediately to treat anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition, which overrides the need for a prescription in urgent cases.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Adrenaline is a prescription-only medicine and is administered intramuscularly \u2013 This is correct. Adrenaline is indeed a prescription-only medicine (POM), and the recommended route of administration for anaphylaxis is intramuscularly (IM), typically into the anterolateral thigh.\r\n\r\nB) Pharmacists need to have training regarding recognising and treating Anaphylaxis \u2013 This is correct. Pharmacists should have appropriate training in recognising and managing anaphylaxis to ensure effective and timely intervention, including the administration of adrenaline when necessary.\r\n\r\nC) Pharmacists providing vaccination services must have access to an Anaphylaxis pack \u2013 This is correct. Pharmacists who provide vaccination services must have access to an anaphylaxis pack, including adrenaline, in case of an allergic reaction following a vaccination.\r\n\r\nE) Pharmacists who administered adrenaline also need to ensure an ambulance is called \u2013 This is correct. Following the administration of adrenaline for anaphylaxis, it is essential that an ambulance is called, as the patient may require further medical treatment and monitoring in a hospital setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPharmacists are authorised to administer adrenaline in emergency situations such as anaphylaxis without requiring a prescription. The Human Medicines Regulations 2012 allow for the immediate administration of adrenaline in emergencies, particularly for the treatment of severe allergic reactions. Pharmacists must have appropriate training in recognising and managing anaphylaxis and should have access to an anaphylaxis pack when providing services like vaccinations. It is also essential that, after administering adrenaline, an ambulance is called to ensure the patient receives further care and observation. The overall goal is to ensure timely, safe, and effective treatment to prevent life-threatening consequences.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal  issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(a) Call the police immediately\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe correct response is to call the police immediately. The NHS England guidelines advise pharmacists not to dispense potentially suspicious prescriptions under these circumstances, especially if a patient becomes aggressive. Pharmacists are advised to stall for time and verify the prescription with the prescriber using a verified, published contact number\u2014not the number listed on the prescription itself, which could be falsified.\r\n\r\nIf the patient remains in the pharmacy and becomes aggressive or poses a potential threat, calling 999 is essential to ensure the safety of staff and other customers. Additionally, pharmacists should notify NHS England and the NHS Counter Fraud Authority to report the incident, allowing further investigation and monitoring of potentially fraudulent or unsafe prescriptions.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(b) Call the prescriber using the number on the prescription \u2013 Using the number on the prescription is discouraged as it may not be legitimate. NHS England recommends using a verified, public number.\r\n\r\n(c) Dispense both amoxicillin and diazepam \u2013 Dispensing the medication without verification may be unsafe, especially given the aggressive behavior and potential risk of misuse with diazepam, a controlled drug.\r\n\r\n(d) Dispense amoxicillin only \u2013 Partial dispensing without verification is also inappropriate in a suspicious scenario.\r\n\r\n(e) Tell her the medicine is not in stock and give the prescription back \u2013 This may not resolve the situation and could increase the potential for conflict without addressing safety concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen faced with a potentially aggressive patient presenting a prescription that includes controlled substances like diazepam, pharmacists are advised to prioritise safety and adhere to NHS England guidance. This includes refraining from dispensing the medication, verifying the prescriber's details using an official contact, and notifying the police if necessary. Reporting incidents to NHS England and NHS Counter Fraud Authority is crucial for broader monitoring and preventing prescription fraud or misuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information:\u00a0\r\n\r\nWatch MEP lesson on Chapter 1 ( Core concepts and skills)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep\r\n\r\nhttps://www.england.nhs.uk/south/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/2021-22-forged-prescriptions-guidance.pdf",

    "why": "E. The Vet\u2019s registration number is missing, so this must be added.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013, as amended, a veterinary prescription must include all legally required details to ensure it is valid and compliant. One key legal requirement is the inclusion of the vet\u2019s registration number on prescriptions for Controlled Drugs (CDs), which allows traceability and accountability. If this detail is missing, the prescription is incomplete, and the pharmacy cannot proceed with the supply. The vet must amend and reissue the prescription to include the registration number.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. CD statement is incorrect; therefore, it must be taken back to the vet for correction.\r\nThis is incorrect because while CDs require specific statements (e.g., \"for the treatment of an animal under my care\"), there is no indication in this scenario that the CD statement is incorrect.\r\n\r\nB. Supply the prescription to the owner after making sure the dog lives at the address.\r\nThis is incorrect because even if the address is verified, the missing vet registration number renders the prescription invalid, and supply cannot proceed.\r\n\r\nC. The dosing instructions make this unable to supply for an animal.\r\nThis is incorrect. While veterinary prescriptions must have clear dosing instructions, this is not mentioned as an issue in the scenario.\r\n\r\nD. The medicine is not prescribed under the cascade, so that needs to be corrected before the supply is made.\r\nThis is incorrect. The cascade applies to prescribing unauthorised medicines for animals, but there is no suggestion in the scenario that this is relevant to the prescription.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nWhen dispensing veterinary prescriptions, it is essential to ensure compliance with the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013. For Controlled Drugs (CDs), the vet\u2019s registration number must be included on the prescription, among other legal requirements. If any mandatory detail is missing, the prescription cannot be supplied, and the issue must be corrected by the prescribing vet. Always verify veterinary prescriptions carefully to ensure they meet all legal and professional standards before supply.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "title": "**Which of the following is NOT suitable for a nurse to prescribe?**",
    "text": "Nurse independent prescribers have prescribing restrictions",
    "why": "B) Diamorphine for the treatment of addiction\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nNurse Independent Prescribers (NIPs) are permitted to prescribe certain controlled drugs for medical purposes; however, they are restricted from prescribing these drugs for addiction treatment. Diamorphine, for example, may only be prescribed by NIPs for palliative care but not for the treatment of addiction. Addiction management is a highly specialised area that requires training and expertise typically limited to certain doctors, ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate care under structured regulations.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Diamorphine for palliative care treatment \u2013 NIPs are authorised to prescribe diamorphine for palliative care settings where it is used to manage severe pain, particularly at the end of life. This exception allows NIPs to provide compassionate care by alleviating pain and discomfort in terminally ill patients.\r\n\r\nC) Off-label medicines \u2013 NIPs are allowed to prescribe medicines off-label, meaning the medication is used outside of its licensed indication, provided it is clinically appropriate and aligns with best practice guidelines. This authority helps meet patient needs when standard treatments do not suffice, as long as the prescriber is competent and has a clear clinical rationale.\r\n\r\nD) Schedule 2 Controlled Medicines \u2013 NIPs can prescribe certain Schedule 2 controlled drugs for pain management and other authorised medical uses. However, strict limitations apply, such as the prohibition on prescribing controlled substances like diamorphine for addiction treatment, which ensures patient safety and aligns with prescribing authority boundaries.\r\n\r\nE) Unlicensed medicines \u2013 NIPs may prescribe unlicensed medicines if no licensed alternative meets the patient\u2019s clinical requirements. While unlicensed, these prescriptions must still be justified based on clinical evidence and professional judgement, allowing NIPs to address unique or complex cases where licensed options may not be available.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Medicines, Ethics and Practice (MEP) guidelines and NICE guidelines provide Nurse Independent Prescribers (NIPs) with an extensive scope of prescribing authority. NIPs can prescribe a range of medications, including certain controlled substances, off-label, and unlicensed medications, where clinically justified and within their area of competence. This scope allows NIPs to play a vital role in managing conditions such as chronic pain, palliative care needs, and other complex health issues, contributing to comprehensive patient care.\r\n\r\nHowever, important restrictions apply, particularly concerning controlled drugs in the context of addiction. Prescribing for addiction treatment remains outside the scope of NIPs, as this field requires highly specialised expertise to ensure safe and effective care for patients dealing with substance dependence. Addiction treatment is legally regulated and requires prescribers with specific training, usually limited to qualified doctors with expertise in this area.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, MEP and NICE guidelines stipulate that NIPs prescribing off-label or unlicensed medications should do so only when a suitable licensed alternative is unavailable and when they possess the requisite clinical knowledge. This flexibility is essential in scenarios where licensed therapies are insufficient, allowing NIPs to fulfil patient needs within safe and ethical boundaries.\r\n\r\nThese guidelines safeguard patient welfare, encourage responsible prescribing, and support regulatory compliance, ensuring that NIPs deliver care effectively while respecting professional limitations. This structured approach helps maintain high standards of care, promotes patient safety, and reinforces the importance of specialised training for managing complex conditions such as addiction.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "You are the responsible pharmacist in a community pharmacy running a supervised methadone clinic. One of your clients regularly misses their collection.",
    "why": "B. 3 consecutive days\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the guidelines for supervised methadone dispensing, if a patient misses three consecutive days of treatment, they would be considered \"off script.\" This is based on the principle that missing multiple doses of methadone increases the risk of opioid overdose due to the loss of tolerance, which can lead to significant harm.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA. 2 consecutive days:\r\nThis is incorrect because the \"off script\" criteria are specifically related to missing three consecutive days of treatment. Missing two days alone does not trigger this classification.\r\n\r\nC. 3 unconsecutive days:\r\nThis is incorrect. It is the consecutive missed days that are the primary concern for determining when a patient is \"off script,\" as the gap between doses can significantly affect the risk of harm.\r\n\r\nD. 4 consecutive days:\r\nThis is incorrect. While missing more than three days would also indicate a high risk, the point at which the patient is officially considered \"off script\" is after missing three consecutive days, not four.\r\n\r\nE. 5 consecutive days:\r\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option D. The critical threshold is three consecutive days, and while missing five days would definitely place the patient at risk, the official point of being \"off script\" occurs after three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the context of supervised methadone dispensing, the key risk is that a patient who misses three consecutive days of methadone treatment may lose their tolerance to opioids. If a patient misses three consecutive doses, their risk of overdose upon resuming treatment is significantly increased. As a result, patients in this situation are considered \"off script,\" and alternative actions, such as consulting the prescriber or re-evaluating the patient's treatment plan, would be necessary to ensure their safety. The guidelines emphasise the importance of continuity in methadone administration to prevent withdrawal and overdose risks.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Midwives can obtain certain Controlled drugs via midwife supply order",
    "why": "D. Signature of midwife\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is Signature of midwife. A midwife supply order does not require the signature of the midwife. Instead, the order must include the signature of the appropriate medical officer\u2014either a doctor authorised by the local supervising authority or an appointee of a person with such authority. This signature requirement ensures proper authorisation and accountability for controlled drug supply.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. Name of midwife \u2013 Legally required, as it identifies the midwife requesting the controlled drugs.\r\nB. Occupation of midwife \u2013 Required to verify the professional status of the requestor as a midwife.\r\nC. Purpose of midwife supply order \u2013 Necessary to specify the intended use for the controlled drugs.\r\nE. Total quantity of drug to be obtained \u2013 Required to indicate the exact amount of controlled drugs to be supplied.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, midwife supply orders for controlled drugs must be properly documented and authorised. The legal requirements ensure appropriate control and minimise misuse by specifying key details like the midwife\u2019s name, occupation, purpose, and total quantity needed. However, the midwife\u2019s signature is not required; the authorisation signature must come from a designated medical officer. This system upholds both accountability and safety in the handling of controlled substances.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Regulation 224 of the human medicines regulations 2012 enables emergencies supplies on the request of a prescriber",
    "why": "B) Maximum of 30 days supply of medication\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis statement is incorrect. The maximum supply of medication for an emergency supply at the request of a prescriber does not have a set limit of 30 days. Unlike emergency supplies requested by a patient, which are limited to a maximum of 30 days, emergency supplies requested by a prescriber are not subject to such a restriction. The amount of medication supplied is determined based on the clinical need and the prescriber\u2019s directions.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Entry must be made in the POM register \u2013 This is a correct requirement. When an emergency supply is made, an entry must be recorded in the Prescription-Only Medicines (POM) register, which ensures proper tracking and documentation of the supply in compliance with regulatory standards.\r\n\r\nC) Medicine is supplied in accordance to prescriber directions \u2013 This is accurate. The medicine supplied under an emergency supply request from a prescriber must be given in accordance with the directions provided by the prescriber, ensuring the treatment aligns with the intended clinical management.\r\n\r\nD) Prescription must be provided within 72 hours \u2013 This is a correct condition. For an emergency supply at the request of a prescriber, the patient must obtain a full prescription within 72 hours. This ensures that the emergency supply is only a temporary solution until the proper prescription is issued.\r\n\r\nE) Schedule 2 Controlled drugs cannot be supplied \u2013 This is accurate. Schedule 2 controlled drugs cannot be supplied as an emergency supply under Regulation 224. These medications are subject to strict controls, and their supply must be managed according to additional regulations that prevent emergency provision.\r\n\r\nRegulation 224 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 outlines the provisions for emergency supplies made at the request of a prescriber. This regulation allows pharmacists to provide an emergency supply of medication to patients when a prescriber requests it, provided that specific conditions are met.\r\n\r\nThe key requirements include that the supply must be recorded in the POM register, and the medicine must be dispensed according to the prescriber\u2019s instructions. For Schedule 2 controlled drugs, emergency supplies cannot be made, ensuring strict control over these substances. Additionally, the patient must obtain a prescription within 72 hours of receiving the emergency supply.\r\n\r\nImportantly, unlike patient-requested emergency supplies, which are limited to a 30-day supply, there is no maximum supply period for emergency supplies requested by a prescriber. This distinction helps ensure that patients receive the necessary amount of medication based on their individual needs, as determined by the prescriber, while also maintaining compliance with legal and regulatory frameworks designed to ensure patient safety.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Your counter assistant translated the prescription fully for you and you are confident of the appropriateness. The prescription is dated within the past 28 days.",
    "why": "E. You are satisfied with the prescription and supply the morphine sulphate oral solution.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines, European Economic Area (EEA) professionals (such as doctors from France) are permitted to prescribe controlled drugs (CDs) within the UK, provided they comply with the necessary legal requirements outlined in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (Regulation 218).\r\n\r\nMorphine sulphate oral solution is a Schedule 5 controlled drug. Prescriptions for controlled drugs can be written by registered EEA doctors, as long as the prescription meets all the requirements, such as the correct prescription format, patient details, drug details, and appropriate dosage. A translation service like Language Line is an option if there are issues with understanding a non-English prescription, but since the prescription has already been translated by a reliable source (the counter assistant), this step is not necessary in this case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the prescription is valid, and the most appropriate action is to supply the morphine sulphate oral solution.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nA. Refuse the supply as CD prescriptions must be written by a UK doctor.\r\nThis is incorrect because EEA doctors are allowed to prescribe controlled drugs in the UK, as per Regulation 218 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. There is no requirement for the prescription to be written by a UK doctor.\r\n\r\nB. Refuse the supply and request the patient make an appointment with a UK doctor to get a private prescription.\r\nThis is incorrect because the prescription from the EEA doctor is valid. There is no need to request a new prescription from a UK doctor, as long as all the prescription requirements have been met.\r\n\r\nC. Refuse the supply as you must not supply a prescription if it's not written in English.\r\nThis is incorrect. While it is important for prescriptions to be clear and understandable, a prescription written in a foreign language can be valid as long as it is properly translated. In this case, the translation has already been provided, so this is not a valid reason to refuse supply.\r\n\r\nD. Refuse the supply but supply another over-the-counter opiate such as co-codamol.\r\nThis is incorrect because supplying a different opiate (such as co-codamol) without proper medical authorisation would be inappropriate. The patient has a valid prescription for morphine sulphate, so it should be supplied as prescribed, not substituted with another medication.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nIn the UK, EEA doctors are authorised to prescribe controlled drugs such as morphine sulphate (a Schedule 5 controlled drug). The prescription must meet all legal requirements, including the correct format and details. If the prescription is in a foreign language, it can be valid as long as it is properly translated. Therefore, the prescription from the French doctor is legitimate, and the morphine sulphate oral solution should be supplied as prescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 2 (Professional and legal issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

As a non-Welsh-speaking pharmacist, you might not fully understand Welsh labels, which increases the risk of errors. Writing labels in English ensures you can review and verify the information.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelsh prescriptions are legally valid and recognised in Wales, and pharmacists must ensure they handle these appropriately to maintain patient safety. Key considerations include:\r\n\r\nTranslation services: Use reliable services such as Language Line to ensure accurate interpretation of prescriptions written in Welsh.\r\nDispensing labels: Non-Welsh-speaking pharmacists should write dispensing instructions in English to minimise errors.\r\nPatient communication: If clarification is required, discuss with the patient or prescriber in a respectful and professional manner.\r\nLegality: It is legal to dispense Welsh prescriptions, provided the pharmacist ensures accurate understanding of the instructions.\r\nBy following these steps, pharmacists can ensure safe and effective dispensing while meeting the needs of all patients.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 4 (The Responsible Pharmacist)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

The doctor cannot requisition for schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guidelines and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, it is entirely legal for a doctor to requisition Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 controlled drugs (CDs) such as morphine. Morphine is commonly used for pain management in palliative care, and a requisition can be made if all legal requirements are fulfilled. Suggesting otherwise is incorrect and inappropriate.\r\n\r\nRequirements for a Controlled Drug Requisition:\r\n\r\nA controlled drug requisition must include the following:\r\n\r\nSignature of the requester.\r\nName, address, and profession/occupation of the person requisitioning the drug.\r\nTotal quantity of the drug to be supplied.\r\nPurpose for which the drug is required (this can be inferred if the drug is being used within the normal course of professional practice).\r\nStandardised requisition form (FP10CDF) for CDs in England.\r\n\r\nWhy the Other Options Are Incorrect:\r\n\r\nB.

The doctor requisitioning the CDs must sign the requisition form themselves, as per legal requirements.\r\n\r\nC. The doctor must state his profession/occupation on the requisition.\r\nThis is correct advice. The doctor must state their profession, as this is a legal requirement for all CD requisitions.\r\n\r\nD. The doctor must use a standardised NHS form when requesting the medication.\r\nThis is correct advice. In England, a standardised form (FP10CDF) must be used for requisitions of Schedule 2 and 3 CDs.\r\n\r\nE. The proposed use of the medicine must be stated on the requisition.\r\nWhile the explicit use does not have to be detailed in all cases, stating the purpose is considered good practice. For controlled drugs, the intended use is often implied (e.g., for professional medical use). This option is still correct advice when ensuring clarity on a requisition.\r\n\r\nA doctor can legally requisition Schedule 2 and 3 controlled drugs like morphine for legitimate medical purposes, provided all legal requirements are met.

While drug interactions are important information for pharmacists to consider, they are not a legal requirement to be included on the label of broken bulk medicines. The legal labelling requirements for broken bulk medicines focus on information directly related to the medicine's identity, safety, and handling, rather than its interactions with other drugs.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) Batch reference number \u2013 This is required for broken bulk labelling. The batch number ensures traceability in case of a recall or quality control issues and is part of the legal requirements for labelling.\r\n\r\nC) Expiry date \u2013 This is required for broken bulk labelling. The expiry date ensures that the medicine is used before it becomes ineffective or potentially unsafe.\r\n\r\nD) Name of medicine \u2013 This is required for broken bulk labelling. The name of the medicine is essential for identifying the product, ensuring that it is dispensed and used correctly.\r\n\r\nE) Quantity of medicines \u2013 This is required for broken bulk labelling. The quantity of medicine being dispensed (e.g., number of tablets or volume) must be clearly stated to ensure proper dosing and to comply with labelling regulations.\r\n\r\nUnder UK law, when breaking down bulk containers of medicines into smaller quantities suitable for dispensing, certain label requirements must be followed to ensure the safe and effective use of the medicine. The label must include the name of the medicine, the quantity, the expiry date, the batch reference number, and any relevant handling and storage requirements. Drug interactions are important for clinical consideration but do not need to be included on the label of the broken bulk container. These labelling regulations help ensure that medicines are correctly identified, stored, and used, and that there is traceability in case of any issues with the product.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "A 32 year old male patient presents to your pharmacy explaining he is away from home and requires an emergency supply of co-codamol 30/500mg tablets.. After checking the Summary Care Record, you determine the request is valid.",
    "why": "B) 5 days\r\n\r\nRationale: \r\n\r\nWhen supplying a controlled drug (CD) under an emergency supply, the maximum quantity that can be provided is dependent on the schedule of the medication and the specific legal requirements set out in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, as amended. For Schedule 5 controlled drugs, such as co-codamol 30/500mg (which contains codeine phosphate), you can only provide a maximum of 5 days' worth of treatment under an emergency supply.\r\n\r\nEmergency supply regulations (Regulation 225) dictate that, for Schedule 5 CDs, the quantity supplied should be no more than a 5-day supply. If a patient requires more than 5 days' worth, they must have a prescription issued from a registered prescriber.\r\nOther Options:\r\n\r\nA) 3 days: This is not correct as the maximum supply for a Schedule 5 controlled drug is 5 days, not 3 days. A 3-day supply could apply to other medications or different emergency supply situations, but not for Schedule 5 controlled drugs.\r\n\r\nC) 7 days: This is incorrect. A 7-day supply could be applicable for some medications, such as non-controlled drugs under emergency supply regulations, but for Schedule 5 controlled drugs, the limit is 5 days.\r\n\r\nD) 28 days: This is not appropriate for controlled drugs. A 28-day supply is typically seen for other prescriptions like regular, non-controlled medications or repeat prescriptions, but controlled drugs like co-codamol 30/500mg are strictly regulated.\r\n\r\nE) 30 days: Similarly, a 30-day supply is far beyond the legal limit for controlled drugs under emergency supply provisions, especially for Schedule 5 drugs. This would be more appropriate for chronic conditions but not for controlled drugs like co-codamol.\r\n\r\nUnder Regulation 225 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, the maximum supply for a Schedule 5 controlled drug, such as co-codamol 30/500mg, can only be up to 5 days in an emergency situation. This regulation ensures that while emergency supplies can be made to prevent harm to the patient, there is a limit on how much controlled substance can be dispensed without a prescription. Beyond 5 days, a prescription is required to comply with legal standards and patient safety.\r\n\r\nThis guideline is essential for pharmacy practice to ensure that controlled drugs are handled appropriately and within the constraints of the law, safeguarding both the patient and the pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "Some Controlled medicines have shorter validity on prescriptions",
    "why": "(c) Oramorph 10mg/5mL oral suspension\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nOramorph 10mg/5mL oral suspension is classified as a Schedule 5 Controlled Drug. Prescriptions for Schedule 5 drugs have a validity of 6 months from the appropriate date on the prescription. This longer validity period is due to the lower potential for abuse and dependence associated with Schedule 5 drugs, compared to those in Schedules 2, 3, and 4, which have a stricter 28-day validity.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) Clenbutarol: Not a controlled drug, but it would generally follow standard prescription validity rules, typically 6 months unless otherwise specified.\r\n\r\n(b) Methadone: Methadone is a Schedule 2 Controlled Drug, which requires prescriptions to be dispensed within 28 days of the appropriate date.\r\n\r\n(d) Oxycodone: Oxycodone is also a Schedule 2 Controlled Drug, requiring dispensing within 28 days.\r\n\r\n(e) Pregabalin: Pregabalin is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug with a prescription validity of 28 days.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guide and NICE guidelines outline specific validity periods for different schedules of controlled drugs. Schedule 5 drugs, such as low-strength morphine preparations (e.g., Oramorph 10mg/5mL oral suspension), have reduced regulatory controls due to their lower abuse potential, allowing prescriptions to be valid for 6 months. Higher schedules (Schedules 2, 3, and certain Schedule 4 drugs) are subject to tighter controls, including the shorter 28-day prescription validity.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(D) Treat it as a private prescription and ask the patient to pay full costs before receiving the medicine.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe FMed296 form is a prescription issued by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for military personnel. If presented at a non-contracted pharmacy, like in this case, the prescription should be treated as a private one. The patient is responsible for paying the full costs upfront, and they can later seek reimbursement from their military unit if eligible.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Advise the patient to return to their military base for a new prescription:\r\nNot required. The patient does not need a new prescription. They simply need to cover the costs themselves at a non-contracted pharmacy.\r\n\r\n(B) Dispense the medication without any further action:\r\nIncorrect. As the pharmacy is not contracted with the MOD, payment is required upfront, and the MOD will not cover direct costs in this situation.\r\n\r\n(C) Refuse to dispense the medication:\r\nUnnecessary. The prescription can be dispensed; however, it must be treated as a private prescription with upfront payment.\r\n\r\n(E) Send an invoice for services directly to the Ministry of Defence (MOD):\r\nIncorrect. Non-contracted pharmacies are not authorised to invoice the MOD directly. The patient must pay and handle reimbursement independently if eligible.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, prescriptions issued under FMed296 for MOD personnel are typically managed by contracted pharmacies. If a patient presents this prescription at a non-contracted pharmacy, it is treated as a private prescription, meaning the individual must pay the full cost of the medication upfront. This setup ensures that military personnel can still access necessary medicines, while maintaining clarity on payment responsibilities. The individual may pursue reimbursement directly through their military unit, contingent on their entitlements. This approach aligns with MEP guidance on handling MOD prescriptions outside contracted pharmacies.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch the MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "A female patient who wears contact lenses and has been initiated on isotretinoin. Their blood test results are shown below:\r\n\r\nLDL 1.9 mmol/L (<3mmol/L)\r\nALT 42 units/L (7 \u2013 56 units/L)\r\nTotal bilirubin 0.7 mg/dL (0.3 - 1.9 mg/dL)",
    "why": "E. To ensure the patient is not pregnant whilst taking the drug.\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin is a highly teratogenic drug, meaning it poses a significant risk of severe birth defects if taken during pregnancy. For this reason, strict measures are in place to ensure that women of childbearing potential do not conceive while taking isotretinoin. The Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP) mandates that:\r\n\r\nWomen of childbearing potential must have monthly negative pregnancy tests before receiving a new supply.\r\n\r\nPrescriptions for isotretinoin must be limited to a maximum of 30 days to align with these tests and prevent overuse or misuse.\r\n\r\nA. It is routine to supply prescriptions for one month to reduce wastage (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nWhile reducing wastage is a valid pharmacy practice, it is not the primary reason for restricting isotretinoin supplies to a 30-day limit.\r\n\r\nB. To allow for closer monitoring of interacting medicines (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nAlthough isotretinoin has potential drug interactions (e.g., with tetracyclines or vitamin A), the 30-day restriction is specifically linked to the PPP, not to monitoring of drug interactions.\r\n\r\nC. To allow for monthly blood tests and adjust the dose if needed (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nMonitoring blood tests (e.g., lipid profile and liver function tests) is essential during isotretinoin therapy, but the frequency of testing varies by clinical need and is not necessarily tied to the monthly prescription limit.\r\n\r\nD. To ensure good overall adherence with the therapy (Incorrect):\r\n\r\nAlthough adherence is a general goal in any treatment, it is not the rationale for limiting isotretinoin prescriptions to a 30-day supply.\r\n\r\nE. To ensure the patient is not pregnant whilst taking the drug (Correct):\r\n\r\nThe monthly supply restriction ensures that pregnancy tests can be performed regularly and that the patient has ongoing access to contraception, both essential components of the PPP.\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin prescriptions are limited to a 30-day supply for women of childbearing potential due to the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP). This programme aims to minimise the risk of pregnancy during isotretinoin therapy through monthly negative pregnancy tests and strict adherence to contraception.\r\n\r\nAdditional monitoring, such as liver function tests and lipid profiles, is conducted during therapy but does not directly determine the prescription duration. By enforcing these measures, healthcare providers help mitigate the significant risks of isotretinoin-associated teratogenicity.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(c) 5 years\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder the Responsible Pharmacist Regulations 2008 (as amended), the pharmacy record must be retained for 5 years. This record documents the pharmacist responsible for overseeing the safe and effective operation of the pharmacy each day, as well as any significant operational changes or procedures implemented during their shift. Keeping these records for five years ensures regulatory compliance and provides an auditable trail for potential investigations or inspections.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) 2 years: Incorrect. Although certain documents like some NHS prescriptions need to be retained for two years, this retention period does not apply to the pharmacy record.\r\n\r\n(b) 3 years: Incorrect. There is no requirement under the Responsible Pharmacist Regulations to retain pharmacy records for three years.\r\n\r\n(d) 7 years: Incorrect. Seven years is not specified as the retention period for pharmacy records, though it may apply to other medical records in some contexts.\r\n\r\n(e) 10 years: Incorrect. The pharmacy record does not need to be retained for ten years, though this duration may apply to other clinical records in certain cases.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guide, the Responsible Pharmacist (RP) must ensure an accurate and complete pharmacy record, documenting their time in charge of the pharmacy each day. This record includes key details such as the RP\u2019s name, registration number, the dates and times they assumed and relinquished responsibility, and any temporary absences. Additionally, any significant operational adjustments that ensure the safe and effective operation of the pharmacy, such as changes in staffing or procedures, must also be documented. The five-year retention ensures an audit trail that can support regulatory investigations or inspections if any operational concerns or legal queries arise within this period.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 4 (The Responsible Pharmacist)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "(b) Amend the quantity of the prescription to meet all legal requirements and then dispense the prescription\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, Schedule 2 controlled drugs, like fentanyl, have strict prescription requirements, including having the quantity written in both words and figures. However, if either the words or figures are missing (but not both), pharmacists have the authority to make a technical amendment. This involves completing the missing part, signing, and including their full name and GPhC number to validate the correction.\r\n\r\nOther Options Explained:\r\n\r\n(a) Advise the patient to return to their GP for a new prescription: This is not necessary unless both words and figures for the quantity are missing. A pharmacist can amend the prescription if only one part is absent.\r\n\r\n(c) Contact the GP surgery to specify which brand of fentanyl patch is needed: This step would only be required if the prescription specified a brand-related issue. In this case, no brand-related clarification is necessary.\r\n\r\n(d) Provide an emergency supply and request a new prescription from the GP: Emergency supply is not permitted for Schedule 2 controlled drugs like fentanyl, making this option inappropriate.\r\n\r\n(e) The prescription meets all legal requirements therefore dispense the prescription: This option assumes no amendments are needed, but if either the words or figures for the quantity are missing, it does not meet the requirements until corrected.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Medicines, Ethics, and Practice (MEP) guide and NICE guidelines, prescriptions for Schedule 2 controlled drugs such as fentanyl must meet specific requirements. The prescription must include the total quantity written in both words and figures, ensuring clarity and preventing potential misuse or errors. If one part of the quantity (either words or figures) is missing, pharmacists can amend this detail, provided they add their signature, full name, and registration number.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nEmergency supplies are strictly prohibited for Schedule 2 controlled substances (except phenobarbital for epilepsy), and dispensing without correct quantity information is unlawful. These guidelines ensure that prescriptions for controlled drugs meet rigorous standards for both patient safety and legal compliance.\r\n\r\nWatch MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "Correct Answer: \r\n\r\nB) The dose is not legally suitable\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThis is a Schedule 2 Controlled Drug (morphine sulfate), and under Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 and MEP, the prescription must include a clear and unambiguous dose.\r\n\r\nThe phrase:\r\n\r\n\u201cTake every 4\u20136 hours when required\u201d\r\n\r\ndoes not specify the actual dose, such as \"Take 1 tablet every 4\u20136 hours when required\".\r\nWithout the specific number of tablets or quantity to take, the dose is not legally valid and cannot be dispensed.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\nA) A nurse independent prescriber cannot prescribe Sevredol\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 Nurse Independent Prescribers can prescribe Schedule 2 controlled drugs, including morphine sulfate, provided it is within their clinical competence and for legitimate medical need, such as palliative care (MEP Chapter 2).\r\n\r\nC) The prescription has expired\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 Controlled Drug prescriptions are valid for 28 days from the date on the prescription. This prescription is marked \u201cTODAY'S DATE\u201d so it is still within the valid timeframe.\r\n\r\nD) The quantity is not written in words and figures\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 In the extract, the quantity is written as:\r\n\r\n\u201cQuantity: 56 (fifty six)\u201d\r\nThis meets the legal requirement for Controlled Drugs, where the quantity must be written in both words and figures to prevent tampering.\r\n\r\nE) The prescription needs to be on a standardised form\r\n\r\nIncorrect \u2013 This is a standard FP10 prescription used in England by independent prescribers such as GPs, NIPs, and others.\r\n\r\nControlled drug prescriptions must meet certain legal wording and content requirements (e.g. dose, quantity, form, strength), but they do not need to be on a special or different form unless issued in specific settings (e.g. private prescriptions for Schedule 2/3 CDs must be on FP10PCD in England).\r\n\r\nIn this case, since it is an NHS prescription from a nurse independent prescriber, and not a private prescription, it does not need a different standardised form beyond the usual controlled drug legal content requirements.\r\n\r\nControlled Drug Prescription Requirements (MEP & Legal Framework):\r\n\r\n- Under MEP Chapter 2 and Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, a Schedule 2 Controlled Drug prescription must include:\r\n\r\n- The form and strength of the medicine\r\n\r\n- Clear dose (e.g. \"Take 1 tablet every 4\u20136 hours\")\r\n\r\n- Total quantity in words and figures\r\n\r\n- Valid prescriber details and signature\r\n\r\n- Dated within the last 28 days\r\n\r\n- Prescriptions lacking any of these legal requirements (especially an unambiguous dose) are not valid and must not be dispensed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch the MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "why": "B. 30\r\n\r\nRationale\r\n \r\nThe correct answer is 30. According to good practice guidelines and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, it is generally considered appropriate to prescribe a maximum of 30 days of treatment for Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 controlled drugs, such as temazepam. This ensures that there is proper oversight and monitoring of the patient's use of the medication, which helps to mitigate risks of misuse and dependence.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options\r\n\r\nA. 28 \u2013 Incorrect. While some controlled drugs can be prescribed for 28 days, 30 days is generally the recommended duration for treatment, as it allows for a complete course without encouraging excess supply.\r\nC. 56 \u2013 Incorrect. Prescribing for 56 days would be considered excessive for a Schedule 3 controlled drug like temazepam, and may raise concerns regarding potential misuse.\r\nD. 60 \u2013 Incorrect. Similar to 56 days, prescribing for 60 days would not align with best practices for controlled substances.\r\nE. 84 \u2013 Incorrect. 84 days of temazepam would be far beyond the appropriate prescribing duration for a controlled drug and could increase the risk of misuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 controlled drugs, including temazepam, it is considered best practice to prescribe no more than 30 days of treatment at a time. This helps ensure the patient is regularly reviewed and reduces the potential for misuse or dependence. The Misuse of Drugs Regulations and clinical guidelines provide that prescribing larger quantities may increase the risk of medication misuse or overdose.\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 3 (Underpinning knowledge: legislation and professional issues)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

Schedule 4 drugs do not require a standardised private prescription form.\r\n\r\nc) Lorazepam\r\n\r\nLike diazepam, lorazepam is also a Schedule 4 (Part I) Controlled Drug, and therefore a standardised form is not needed.\r\n\r\nd) Sativex\r\n\r\nSativex is a Schedule 4 (Part I) Controlled Drug, which does not require a standardised private prescription form.\r\n\r\ne) Tramadol\r\n\r\nTramadol is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug and must be prescribed on a standardised private prescription form, such as FP10PCD in England.\r\n\r\nKey Points About Controlled Drug Prescriptions\r\n\r\nSchedule 2 and 3 Controlled Drugs:\r\n\r\nMust be prescribed on a standardised private prescription form (e.g. FP10PCD in England).\r\nExamples include tramadol (Schedule 3) and morphine (Schedule 2).\r\n\r\nSchedule 4 and 5 Controlled Drugs:\r\n\r\nThese do not require a standardised form for private prescriptions.\r\nExamples include diazepam, lorazepam, and Sativex.\r\n\r\nMisuse of Drugs Regulations 2001:\r\n\r\nEstablishes the classification of controlled drugs into Schedules 1\u20135.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nIn the UK, private prescriptions for controlled drugs must comply with legal requirements established under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. A standardised private prescription form (e.g. FP10PCD in England) is mandatory for Schedule 2 and 3 Controlled Drugs, including tramadol, to ensure proper documentation and reduce misuse. In contrast, Schedule 4 and 5 Controlled Drugs\u2014such as diazepam, lorazepam, and Sativex\u2014are exempt from this requirement. Pharmacists must verify that prescriptions for controlled drugs meet all legal requirements to maintain compliance and safeguard patient safety. For detailed guidance, refer to MEP Chapter 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information watch MEP lesson chapter 4 (The Responsible Pharmacist)\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",

    "text": "It is a Saturday morning in your local community pharmacy. You receive a prescription for a 31 year old female patient from Greece. She explains to you she is in the UK working for 6 months so her doctor has postdated a number of prescriptions for her\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn extract of the prescription is below:\u00a0\r\n![Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-11-08-28](https://i.ibb.co/YfJtxVM/Screenshot-2024-01-08-at-11-08-28.png)\r\n\r\nAn extract of the BNF has been provided for you.\u00a0\r\n[Tretinoin BNF extract](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/tretinoin-specialist-drug/medicinal-forms/)",
    "why": "(C) Refer the patient to NHS 111 for a prescription with a UK license.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\nThe prescription provided meets the legal requirements set out under Regulation 218 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 for overseas prescriptions. However, Retin-A 0.1% cream is not available in the UK under this brand name or as a direct equivalent. Therefore, it cannot be dispensed as prescribed. The best course of action is to refer the patient to NHS 111, where they can receive guidance on how to obtain a UK-licensed equivalent of tretinoin cream. This ensures the patient can access the treatment they need while following UK legal and regulatory guidelines.\r\n\r\nExplanation of Other Options:\r\n\r\n(A) Advise the patient to return to their doctor and request a new prescription of Retin-A:\r\nIncorrect. This would be impractical, as the patient\u2019s doctor is based in Greece, and Retin-A is unlikely to be prescribed with a UK license there. NHS 111 is a more suitable option for obtaining UK-licensed medication.\r\n\r\n(B) Provide an emergency supply of Retin-A 0.1% cream and request a new prescription from their doctor in Greece:\r\nIncorrect. Retin-A is not available in the UK market, and an emergency supply can only be given if the medicine is obtainable in the UK. An emergency supply would not be appropriate in this case.\r\n\r\n(D) Refuse to dispense the prescription because it does not meet legal requirements:\r\nIncorrect. The prescription is legally valid, but the medication is unavailable in the UK. Referring the patient to NHS 111 for a UK-licensed equivalent is a more suitable response.\r\n\r\n(E) The prescription meets all legal requirements therefore dispense the prescription:\r\nIncorrect. While the prescription is legally valid, Retin-A is unavailable in the UK. Dispensing it as prescribed is not possible.\r\n\r\nOverseas prescriptions are permissible if they meet specific legal requirements, such as including the prescriber's qualifications, address, and clear instructions. However, overseas medications not marketed in the UK cannot be dispensed under these prescriptions. In such cases, referring patients to NHS 111 for a licensed UK equivalent is the recommended course of action, as per MEP guidelines, ensuring patient safety and compliance with UK medicine regulations.\r\n\r\nPlease for more information watch the MEP lesson on Chapter 2 (Professional and Legal Issues):\r\n\r\nhttps://preregshortcuts.com/courses/medicines-ethics-practice-course-mep",
